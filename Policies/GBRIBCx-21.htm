<p class="Title">EMERGENCY PAID SICK LEAVE (COVID-19 PANDEMIC)</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">The United States Congress has enacted the <i>Families First Coronavirus Response Act</i> (FFCRA) to assist employees affected by the COVID-19 outbreak with job-protected leave and emergency paid sick leave. &#160;The provisions of this policy are based on the FFCRA that was in effect from April 1, 2020, until December 31, 2020. &#160;Although the provisions mandated by Congress expired on December 31, 2020, the Bogalusa City Parish School Board shall extend the provisions for <i>Emergency Paid Sick Leave</i> until June 30, 2021, for those employees who have not used their allotted benefits.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">EMERGENCY PAID SICK LEAVE</span></u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">The provisions included here are based on the <i>Emergency Paid Sick Leave Act</i> (EPSLA) of the FFCRA and shall only apply to the COVID-19 outbreak.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Eligibility</span></u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">All full- and part-time employees unable to work (or telework) due to one of the following reasons for leave:</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="margin-top: 0in; list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">The employee is subject to a federal, state or local quarantine or isolation order related to COVID–19.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">The employee has been advised by a health care provider to self-quarantine due to concerns related to COVID–19.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">The employee is experiencing symptoms of COVID–19 and is seeking a medical diagnosis.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">The employee is caring for an individual who is subject to either number 1 or 2 above.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">The employee is experiencing any other substantially similar condition specified by the Secretary of&#160;Health and Human Services in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Labor.</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">“<i>Individual</i>” means an immediate family member, roommate or similar person with whom the employee has a relationship that creates an expectation that the employee would care for the person if he or she self-quarantined or was quarantined.&#160;&#160;Additionally, the individual being cared for shall:</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
<li>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">be subject to a federal, state or local quarantine or isolation order as described above; or,</span><br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Have been advised by a health care provider to self-quarantine based on a belief that he or she has COVID-19, may have COVID-19 or is particularly vulnerable to COVID-19.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Amount of Paid Sick Leave</span></u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">All eligible full-time employees shall be eligible for up to ten (10) days or eighty (80) hours of paid sick leave available to use for the qualifying reasons above.&#160;&#160;Eligible part-time employees are entitled to the number of hours worked, on average, over a two (2)-week period.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; letter-spacing: 0pt; background: #ffffff;"><font color="black">For employees with varying hours, one of two methods for computing the number of hours paid shall be used:</font></span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
<li>
<p>The average number of hours that the employee was scheduled per day over the six (6)-month period ending on the date on which the employee takes leave, including hours for which the employee took leave of any type.&#160;&#160;Or,<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; color: #000000;"><font color="black">If the employee has worked less than six (6) months, the expected number of hours to be scheduled per day at the time of hire.</font></span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p><u><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Rate of Pay</span></u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Paid emergency sick leave shall be paid at the employee's regular rate of pay, or minimum wage, whichever is greater, for leave taken for reasons 1-3 above. &#160;Employees taking leave for reasons 4-6 shall be compensated at two-thirds (</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">⅔</span><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">) their regular rate of pay, or minimum wage, whichever is greater.&#160;&#160;Pay shall not exceed:</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
<li>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">$511 per day and $5,110 in total for leave taken for reasons 1-3 above;</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">$200 per day and $2,000 in total for leave taken for reasons 4-6 above.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Interaction with Other Paid Leave</span></u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">The employee may use emergency paid sick leave under this policy before using any other accrued paid time off for the qualifying reasons stated above.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Employees on emergency FMLA leave under this policy may use emergency paid sick leave concurrently with that leave.&#160;&#160;Emergency paid sick leave may also be used when an employee is on leave under traditional FMLA for his or her own COVID-19-related serious conditions or to care for a qualified family member with such a condition.&#160;&#160;If the employee qualifies for both emergency FMLA and emergency paid sick leave, the employee shall be entitled to use emergency paid sick leave for the first ten (10) work days of emergency FMLA leave which would otherwise be unpaid.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Procedure for Requesting Emergency Paid Sick Leave</span></u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Employees shall notify the School Board of the need and specific reason for leave under this policy.&#160;&#160;A form shall be provided to all employees on the School Board intranet and/or in a manner accessible to all.&#160;&#160;Verbal notification shall be accepted until practicable to provide written notice.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Documentation supporting the need for leave shall be included with the leave request form, such as:</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
<li>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">A copy of the federal, state or local quarantine or isolation order related to COVID-19 applicable to the employee or the name of the governmental entity that issued the order.</span><br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Written documentation by a health care provider advising the employee to self-quarantine due to concerns related to COVID-19 or the name of the provided who advised the employee.</span><br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">The name and relation of the individual for whom the employee is taking leave because the individual is subject to a quarantine or isolation order or is advised to self-quarantine.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Once emergency paid sick leave has begun, the employee and his or her supervisor shall determine reasonable procedures for the employee to report periodically on the employee’s status and intent to continue to receive paid sick time.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Carryover</span></u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Paid emergency sick leave under this policy shall not be provided beyond June 30, 2021.&#160;&#160;Any unused paid sick leave shall not carry over beyond June 30, 2021, or be paid out to employees.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">Job Protections</span></u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">No employee who appropriately utilizes emergency paid sick leave under this policy shall be discharged, disciplined or discriminated against for work time missed due to this leave.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt;">New policy:&#160;&#160;June 25, 2020</span></p>
