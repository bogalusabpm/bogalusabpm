<p class="Title">PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN SCHOOL BOARD MEETINGS</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Bogalusa City School Board desires the citizens of the district to attend its meetings so that they may become better acquainted with the schools and so that the School Board may have opportunity to hear the wishes and/or ideas of the public.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is the policy of the School Board to conduct all meetings in full view of and with welcomed participation by the public.&#160;&#160;However, the School Board reserves the right to recess into or call executive sessions for discussing matters as provided by state law.&#160;&#160;During executive sessions, no action shall be taken or resolutions made.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><u style="text-decoration: underline;">REQUEST FOR ITEM TO BE PLACED ON AGENDA</u></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All delegations or individuals who wish to appear before the School Board and place an item on the agenda shall submit their written requests to the Superintendent at least five (5) working days prior to the meeting date, stating what matters they wish to take up with the School Board and the approximate time such matters should consume at the meeting. Such items will normally be included on the agenda of the meeting at which the delegation or individual wishes to appear before the School Board.&#160;&#160;If not submitted on time to be placed on the agenda, the item will be held over for the next scheduled meeting of the School Board.&#160;&#160;Each delegation appearing before the School Board shall select in advance one (1) person as its spokesperson and statements shall be presented in a concise manner.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><u style="text-decoration: underline;">PUBLIC COMMENT ON AGENDA ITEMS</u></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A public comment period shall be held before any vote is taken on an agenda item.&#160;&#160;Comments from the public shall occur after introduction of the item to be voted on and before any discussion by School Board members.&#160;&#160;&#160;However, a person is not entitled to take up business before the School Board unless the item in which he/she is interested has been placed on the agenda of that meeting, except during the <i>public session</i> of the agenda.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As the School Board reaches each item on its agenda, the School Board President shall recognize those persons indicating a desire to speak on that item.&#160;&#160;No individual may speak without first being recognized by the presiding officer.&#160;&#160;Each person may speak for not more than three (3) minutes on each item, and may speak only once on each agenda item.&#160;&#160;When the individual has been recognized to speak on an agenda item, that individual shall approach the podium.&#160;&#160;The individual shall limit his/her comments to matters that are strictly relevant to that agenda item.&#160;&#160;The individual shall refrain from asking questions or making requests of the Board or staff.&#160;&#160;No accusatory comments or comments relative to the performance of specific employees or potential employees shall be permitted.&#160;&#160;The School Board shall delay its deliberations on each agenda item until all members of the public who wish to address the School Board have been given an opportunity to speak.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In the event that the School Board should add an item to its agenda after the School Board meeting begins, the School Board President shall orally request of the audience whether anyone in attendance would like to speak on the added agenda item.&#160;&#160;Each person indicating a desire to do so shall be given a period not to exceed three (3) minutes to address the School Board on each added agenda item.&#160;&#160;The School Board shall delay deliberations on that agenda item until such time as all interested members of the public have had an opportunity to speak.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At the conclusion of all public input on each agenda item, the School Board shall deliberate the matter and take such action as it considers appropriate.&#160;&#160;There shall be no further public input allowed on each agenda item after the School Board has begun its deliberation of that item.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Copies of this procedure shall be available for distribution to the public during regular business hours and at meetings of the School Board and its committees.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><u style="text-decoration: underline;">PUBLIC SESSION</u></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The <i>public session</i> section of the agenda, which shall be held during the regular meetings, shall be designed to give the public an opportunity to make statements or comments on school related issues and/or present petitions to the School Board.&#160;&#160;No speaker shall be allowed to speak until recognized to do so by the President.&#160;&#160;At any time when a member of the public addresses the School Board, it shall require that the speaker give his/her name and address.&#160;&#160;Derogatory statements about, or directed at, a School Board member or any employee shall not be allowed.&#160;&#160;Speakers who wish to make such comments shall be directed to submit their complaints by signed written statement.&#160;&#160;Written complaints will be referred to the President of the School Board, the Superintendent, or a designee who shall investigate the complaint, initiate further appropriate action, and notify the members of the School Board of its disposition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The School Board or Superintendent and his/her staff will not, as a rule, answer questions from the public during any <i>public session</i>.&#160;&#160;The questioner’s name, address and telephone number shall be taken for later personal reply.&#160;&#160;Previously stated School Board policies or administrative rules and regulations may be explained, however.&#160;&#160;A School Board member may, with the President’s permission, ask a question of the speaker.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Those who wish to address the School Board during any <i>public session</i> shall be given a preference by arranging an appointment to speak by calling or writing the office of the Superintendent by 5:00 p.m. of the day preceding the meeting.&#160;&#160;A person who has not made a prior appointment may speak only during any <i>public session</i> after those who have made an appointment.&#160;&#160;Each speaker shall be given three (3) minutes to express his/her views.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
