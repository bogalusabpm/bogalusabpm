<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><u>INTERNET SAFETY</u></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Internet is a vast, global computer network that provides access to major universities, governmental agencies, other school systems, and commercial providers of data banks.&#160;&#160;The Bogalusa City School Board shall establish appropriate guidelines for exploring and using Internet resources within the school district to enhance learning and teaching activities.&#160;&#160;Acceptable use of these resources shall be consistent with the philosophy, goals and objectives of the Bogalusa City School Board.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Age and grade appropriate classroom instruction shall be provided regarding Internet and cell phone safety.&#160;&#160;Such instruction shall include appropriate online behavior, interacting with other individuals on social networking websites and in chat rooms, and cyberbullying awareness and response, as well as areas of concern as authorized in state and federal law.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In addition, the School Board, in conjunction with local law enforcement agencies, shall develop and distribute age and grade appropriate information to each student regarding Internet and cell phone safety and online content that is a threat to school safety.&#160;&#160;The information shall include the following:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
<li>
<p>Instruction on how to detect potential threats to school safety exhibited online, including posting on any social media platform.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visual examples of possible threats.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process for reporting potential threats, which shall be in accordance with the procedures referenced in policy <i><a href="EBBB-18.htm">EBBB, School and Student Safety</a>.</i></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Such information shall be either distributed to or explained to students and school personnel at the beginning of each school year and shall be posted on an easily accessible page of the School Board’s website and the website of each school.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If information reported to a school is deemed a potential threat to school safety, the school shall present the written form and any further evidence to local law enforcement.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In its continued efforts to comply with the <i>Children's Internet Protection Act</i>, the School Board shall adopt and enforce a policy of Internet safety that incorporates the use of computer-related technology or the use of Internet service provider technology designed to block or filter Internet access for minors and adults to certain visual depictions, including without limitation those that are obscene, child pornographic, or harmful to minors, including without limitation sites that are excessively, violent, pervasively vulgar, or sexually harassing.&#160;&#160;Sites which contain information on the manufacturing of bombs or other incendiary devices shall also be prohibited.&#160;&#160;Only authorized persons may disable for an adult user the blocking or filtering mechanism in order to enable Internet access for bona fide research or other lawful purposes, which shall include online services for legitimate scientific or educational purposes approved by the School Board, or access to online services of a newspaper with a daily circulation of at least 1,000.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
