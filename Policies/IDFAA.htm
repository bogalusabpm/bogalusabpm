<p class="Title">DRUG SCREENING</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is the policy of the Bogalusa City School Board to take all extra precautions to assure that students will be accorded every reasonable safety measure in high school athletics and extracurricular activities.&#160;&#160;Extracurricular activity is not a required part of the educational process, and thus is not mandated by the School Board.&#160;&#160;Through participation in athletics, students in athletics and other extracurricular activities using illegal drugs pose a threat to their own health and safety, as well as to that of other students.&#160;&#160;The purpose of this program is (1) to provide for the health and safety of all student athletes and other extracurricular students:&#160;&#160;(2) to undermine the effects of peer pressure by providing a legitimate reason for student athletes and other extracurricular students to refuse to use illegal drugs; and (3) to encourage student athletes and other extracurricular participants who use drugs to participate in drug treatment programs.&#160;&#160;The program is non-punitive.&#160;&#160;It is designed to create a safe, drug free environment for student athletes and other participants in extracurricular activities and assist them in getting help when needed.&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All high school athletes, male and female, and participants in other extracurricular activities shall be subject to mandatory drug testing by urinalysis, hair sample and/or any other method approved at the sole discretion of the Bogalusa City School Board.&#160;&#160;This policy calls for testing of up to ten percent (10%) of the currently active interscholastic athletes and other extracurricular participants in Bogalusa High School. The procedure for random drug testing of athletes and extracurricular participants shall be performed in conjunction with an independent drug testing Vendor selected by the Bogalusa City School Board.&#160;&#160;The Principal and/or the Athletic Director at each school in conjunction with the Vendor, shall determine the date of the testing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Vendor shall be provided by the Building Principal and/or the Athletic Director of Bogalusa High School a list of eligible in-season high school student athletes and other extracurricular participants and in turn shall randomly select up to ten percent (10%) of these students for drug testing at regular intervals.&#160;&#160;The Vendor will send qualified collectors to the school who will oversee the collection of all specimens as outlined in this policy.&#160;&#160;The Vendor will provide Medical Review Officer (MRO) services for interpretation and verification of results.&#160;&#160;Results shall be reported to the Principal by the MRO.&#160;&#160;Urine specimens shall be collected as split specimens.&#160;&#160;If the sample is positive, the student is offered options of participation in a drug assistance program for six (6) weeks or denial of participation in athletics or extracurricular activities for the current school year and the next school year.&#160;</p>

<br />
Prior to participating in any <i>Louisiana High School Athletic Association</i> (LHSAA) sanctioned sport, the student athlete and parent/guardian shall be required to sign the <i>LHSAA Substance Abuse/Misuse Contract</i> and the <i>Bogalusa City School District Drug Testing and Consent</i> form. &#160;&#160;Extracurricular participants shall be required to sign the <i>Bogalusa School District Drug Testing and Consent</i> form. These arrangements state that all extracurricular participants and student athletes shall be subject to random drug testing.&#160;&#160;These tests shall be strictly enforced and participation shall be mandatory, since the parents/guardians have freely chosen to allow their son(s)/daughter(s) to participate in such programs.&#160;&#160;No athlete/extracurricular participant shall be tested unless the parent(s)/guardian(s) and the athlete sign both the LHSAA and Bogalusa City School District forms giving permission to have the tests performed.&#160;&#160;Refusal to allow these tests to be administered shall immediately serve notice that the student may not participate in any interscholastic athletics or extracurricular activity.&#160;</span></p>

<br />
At the beginning of each sport season, as determined by the Principal, the Athletic Director, and/or the Louisiana High School Athletic Association, or when a student moves into the Bogalusa City School Board district and joins a sport, all athletes and extracurricular participants wishing to participate in that seasonâ€™s sports may be subject to testing for illicit or banned substances.&#160;&#160;Following initial team testing, up to ten percent (10%) of eligible student athletes or other extracurricular participants will be randomly tested anytime during the athletic year.&#160;&#160;Any student who refuses to submit to drug testing shall not be allowed to practice or participate in athletics, or any extracurricular activities at any high school under the control of the Bogalusa City School Board.&#160;</span></p>

<br />
Samples shall be collected as outlined under Vendor requirements.&#160;&#160;Any eligible athlete or other extracurricular participant selected randomly for drug testing who is not in school on the day of the testing shall be tested at the next available testing time.&#160;&#160;Likewise, any student unable to produce an adequate specimen during the collection period shall be subject to retesting at the next selected testing date.&#160;&#160;Students not able to provide an adequate specimen at the next testing time shall be viewed as refusing to test, and shall not be allowed to practice or participate in athletics or extracurricular activities under the jurisdiction of the School Board. &#160;Arrangements may be made for special collections at a Vendor collection site with prior approval of the Principal and/or Athletic Director of each school.</span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; text-align: justify;"><u style="text-decoration: underline;">CONFIDENTIALITY OF RESULTS</u></p>
<p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; text-align: justify;">All drug tests shall be confidential information and handled accordingly.&#160;&#160;Those persons having results reported to them as set forth in this policy must sign a <i>Confidentiality Statement</i>.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; text-align: justify;"><u style="text-decoration: underline;">VENDOR REQUIREMENTS</u></p>
<p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; text-align: justify;">The Vendor must be able to provide services in accordance with this policy, should utilize testing methods which are generally accepted in the scientific community as being reliable, and should have experience in toxicology testing as well as chain-of-custody procedures.&#160;&#160;The Vendor must be able to test for drug classes or substances as specified by the School Board and/or the LHSAA.&#160;&#160;The Vendor must report, in a confidential manner, in writing, drug screens as negative or positive, and must report positive findings in a confidential manner to the Principal and/or the Athletic Director of the student athlete or other extracurricular participantâ€™s high school.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; text-align: justify;">The Vendor, testing laboratory or MRO may not release any statistics on the rate of positive drug tests to any person, organization, news publication or media without expressed written consent of the Bogalusa City School Board. &#160;However, the Vendor shall provide the Principal and/or the Athletic Director with a quarterly report showing number of tests performed, rate of positive and negative tests, and what substance(s) were found in the positive specimens.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; text-align: justify;"><u style="text-decoration: underline;">POSITIVE TEST RESULTS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Whenever a student athlete or other extracurricular participantâ€™s test result indicates the presence of illegal drugs or banned substances, or the MRO rules the specimen adulterated, school personnel shall proceed as follows:<br />
&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">

<p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">The Principalâ€™s Office, within twenty-four (24) hours, shall notify the parent(s)/guardian(s)/custodians(s) first, then the student and Athletic Director of Bogalusa High School.&#160;&#160;A written notification from the Principalâ€™s office, by form letter, shall be sent to the parent(s)/guardian(s)/custodian(s) by certified mail.&#160;&#160;The Principal may keep all test results for a period of up to one (1) year.<br />
&#160;</p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">The student shall be notified and may be required to submit to weekly drug tests for six (6) weeks.&#160;&#160;<br />

<p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">If the parent(s)/guardian(s)/custodian(s) or student wishes to contest the results, the Vendor will arrange for the split portion of the specimen to be submitted to another laboratory approved by the Bogalusa City School Board, for testing.&#160;&#160;This is to be done at parent(s)/guardian(s)/custodian(s) or student expense.&#160;&#160;Such a request must be made to the Principal in writing within five (5) working days from first notification of positive test results either to the parent(s)/guardian(s)/custodian(s) or student.<br />
&#160;</p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p style="margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px;">The MRO may use quantitative results to determine if positive results on repeat testing indicate recent use of illicit or banned substances or the natural decline of levels of the illicit or banned substance from the body.&#160;&#160;If the MRO feels the quantitative levels determined to be above established cutoffs do not reflect current use but natural decay, then a negative result may be reported.</p>

For the second positive result within any two (2) consecutive calendar years, the student athlete and extracurricular participant shall be permanently denied the privilege of participation in athletics in the Bogalusa City School System.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; text-align: justify;">No student athlete or other extracurricular participant will be penalized academically for testing positive for illegal drugs or banned substances.&#160;&#160;The results of drug tests pursuant to this policy will not be documented in any studentâ€™s academic records.&#160;&#160;Information regarding the results of drug tests will not be disclosed to criminal or juvenile authorities absent legal compulsion by valid and binding subpoena or other legal process, which the Bogalusa City School Board will not solicit.&#160;&#160;In the event of service of any such subpoena or legal process, the student and the studentâ€™s custodial parent, legal guardian, or custodian shall be notified at least seventy-two (72) hours before response is made by the Bogalusa City School Board, to the extent permitted by such subpoena or legal process.</p>
