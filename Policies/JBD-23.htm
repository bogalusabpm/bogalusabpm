<p class="Title">STUDENT ABSENCES AND EXCUSES</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Bogalusa City School Board recognizes that the fundamental right to attend the public schools places upon students the accompanying responsibility to be faithful in attendance.&#160;&#160;Regular attendance can be assumed to be essential for a student's successful progress in the instructional program.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The parent or legal guardian shall enforce the attendance of the student at the school to which the student is assigned.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The principal of a school, or his/her designee, shall notify the parent or legal guardian in writing on or before a student's <i>third</i> unexcused absence or unexcused occurrence of being tardy, and shall hold a conference with such student's parent or legal guardian.&#160;&#160;This notification shall include information relative to the parent or legal guardian’s legal responsibility to enforce the student’s attendance at school and the civil penalties that may be incurred if the student is determined to be habitually absent or habitually tardy.&#160;&#160;The student's parent or legal guardian shall sign a receipt for such notification.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Each school shall attempt to provide verbal notification to a child's parent, tutor, or legal guardian, and, if such verbal notification cannot be provided, then the school shall provide written notification to a child's parent, tutor, or legal guardian when that child has been absent from school for five (5) school days in schools operating on a semester basis, and for ten (10) days in schools not operating on a semester basis. &#160;The accumulation of days absent need not be consecutive.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>No public elementary or secondary school student shall be permitted for any reason to absent himself/herself from school attendance during the school day upon his/her own authority, unless legally emancipated.&#160;&#160;The principal or designee shall make all reasonable efforts to verbally notify the parent or other person responsible for the student's school attendance of any such prohibited absence by a student.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>TYPES OF ABSENCES</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The days absent for elementary and secondary school students shall include <i>non-exempted</i> <i>excused</i> <i>absences</i>, <i>exempted excused</i> <i>absences, unexcused</i> <i>absences</i>, and <i>suspensions</i>.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><font size="3" style="font-size:12pt;"><i>Suspensions</i> are non-exempted absences for which a student is allowed to make up his/her work and is eligible for consideration for credit provided it is completed satisfactorily and in a timely manner.&#160;&#160;The absence shall be considered when determining whether or not a student may or may not be promoted, but shall not be considered for purposes of truancy.&#160;&#160;Students absent from school as a result of any suspension shall be counted as absent.</font></span></p>

<p>For any other extenuating circumstances, the student’s parents or legal guardian must make a formal appeal in accordance with the due process procedures established by the school system.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Students who are verified as meeting extenuating circumstances, and therefore eligible to receive grades shall not receive those grades if they are unable to complete makeup work or pass the course.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>MENTAL OR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ABSENCES</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A student may be absent for up to three (3) days in any school year related to the student's mental or behavioral health, and such absences shall be excused if certification is provided in writing in accordance with the student handbook.&#160;&#160;The student shall be given the opportunity to make up any school work missed during such absences. &#160;Following the second day of absence in any school year, the student shall be referred to the appropriate school support personnel for help addressing the underlying issue, which may include referral to medical services outside of the school setting.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>SCHOOL-APPROVED ACTIVITIES</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><font size="3" style="font-size:12pt;">Students participating in school-approved field trips or other instructional activities that necessitate their being away from school shall be considered to be present and shall be given the opportunity to make up work.</font></span></p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>WRITTEN EXCUSES</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>For a student to be eligible to receive credit and make up work following an absence, the student shall be required in each instance to submit parental confirmation of the reasons for the absence.&#160;&#160;If a student is tardy or absent, the parent or guardian must submit a written excuse, signed and dated, to school authorities upon the student's return to classes, stating the reason for the student's absence from school.&#160;&#160;A doctor's, dentist’s, or nurse practitioner’s written statement of student's incapacity to attend school shall be required for those absences for three (3) or more consecutive days due to illness, contagious illness in a family, hospitalization, or accidents.&#160;&#160;All excuses for a student's absence, including medical verification of extended personal illness, must be presented within five (5) school days of the student's return to school, or the student's absence shall be considered unexcused and the student not allowed to make up work missed.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>REPORTING ABSENCES</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The attendance of all school students shall be checked each school day and at the beginning of each class period and shall be verified by the teacher keeping such record, which shall be open to inspection by the Supervisor of Child Welfare and Attendance or duly authorized representative at all reasonable times.&#160;&#160;All schools shall immediately report to the Supervisor of Child Welfare and Attendance any unexplained, unexcused, or illegal absence, or habitual tardiness.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Supervisor of Child Welfare and Attendance shall, after written notice to the parent or legal guardian of a child, or a personal visit of notification, report any such child who is habitually absent or who is habitually tardy to the family or juvenile court of the parish as a truant child, there to be dealt with in such manner as the court may determine.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>APPEAL OF ABSENCES</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>When a student exceeds the maximum number of absences allowed the parents or student may make a formal appeal to the principal if they feel any of the absences are because of extenuating circumstances.&#160;&#160;If they feel that the decision is unfavorable, they shall appeal to the Superintendent or his/her designee. &#160;After a review by the Superintendent or his/her designee, a decision shall be made and communicated to the parents or legal guardian by letter.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>High school students in danger of failing due to excessive absences may be allowed to make up missed time in class sessions held outside the regular class time.&#160;&#160;The make-up sessions must be completed before the end of the current semester and all other applicable policies must also be met.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>TARDINESS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A student shall be considered tardy to class if the student is not in the classroom when the bell to begin class ceases.&#160;&#160;A student shall be considered tardy to school if the student is not in his/her homeroom/first period class when the bell to begin homeroom/class ceases.&#160;&#160;Tardy shall also mean leaving or checking out of school unexcused prior to the regularly scheduled dismissal.&#160;&#160;Habitual tardiness on the part of students shall not be tolerated.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Students who exhibit habitual tardiness shall be subject to disciplinary action, appropriate under the circumstances.&#160;&#160;Parents of students who continue to be tardy shall be notified for a conference with the principal, and the student may be subject to suspension from school and the parent/legal guardian subject to court fines or community service.</p>
