<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><u>HEALTH CARE CENTERS</u></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to provide adequate health care and services to students, the Bogalusa City School Board may authorize the establishment of student health care centers in the schools of the parish.&#160;&#160;Any health clinic established shall be supervised by a school nurse, who shall be licensed in accordance with state law.&#160;&#160;Health care centers shall provide services which include, but are not limited to the following:&#160;&#160;treatment of minor illness and injury, routine physical examinations, immunizations, referrals to alcohol and drug abuse prevention program counselors, and mental health services.&#160;&#160;No student shall receive any type of service unless the required standardized school health forms as outlined in <a href="../Bulletins/Bulletin135.pdf#311" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;"><i>Health and Safety</i>, Bulletin 135</a> have been signed, returned to school, and have been filed in the clinic.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><u>HEARING AND VISION SCREENING</u></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The School Board, during the first semester of the school year, or within thirty (30) days after the admission of students entering school late in the session, shall test the sight, including color screening for all first grade students, and hearing of students according to the schedule outlined by the American Academy of Pediatrics, except those students whose parents or guardians may object to such tests. &#160;Vision and hearing screenings will be performed annually for Pre-K, K, 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th, and 11th grades, and when requested by the parent, a teacher, or the Department of Special Education.&#160;&#160;A referral form will be sent home for those students requiring further evaluation outside of school.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A record of such examination shall be kept and the administrators shall be required to follow up on the deficiencies within sixty (60) days, and shall notify in writing the parent or tutor of every student found to have any defect of sight or hearing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><u>SCOLIOSIS SCREENING</u></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Scoliosis screening may be performed for 5th grade boys and girls with parental consent.&#160;&#160;Referrals shall be made as need for follow-up exams with the studentâ€™s physician.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><u>EDUCATIONAL SCREENING AND EVALUATION</u></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p class="A" style="margin-bottom: 0in; text-indent: 0in;"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><font size="3" style="font-size:12pt;">Every student in grades kindergarten through third shall be screened, at least once, for the existence of impediments to a successful school experience. &#160;No student shall be screened if his/her parent or guardian objects to such screening.&#160;&#160;Such impediments shall include:</font></span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>dyslexia and related disorders;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>attention deficit disorder; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>social and environmental factors that put a student "at risk."</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Students in need of services and/or assistance shall have it provided to them.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The screenings shall be done directly by elementary school counselors, pupil appraisal personnel, teachers, or any other professional employees of the School Board who have been appropriately trained, all of whom shall operate as advocates for the students identified as needing services or assistance. &#160;No screenings shall be done by persons who have not been trained to do such screenings.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board shall ensure that educational screening activities, conducted by a committee at the school level, shall be completed before a student is referred for an individual evaluation through pupil appraisal services.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Students who are experiencing learning or adjustment difficulties in a regular program, but are not thought to be exceptional, may receive support services from pupil appraisal by a referral from a committee at the school level.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Testing for Dyslexia</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A dyslexia screener selected by the Louisiana Department of Education shall be administered to each student in the second half of kindergarten, or upon the request of a teacher or parent or legal guardian. &#160;The School Board shall provide remediation for students with dyslexia or related disorders in an appropriate education program.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>For purposes of this policy, <i>dyslexia</i> shall be defined as an unexpected difficulty in reading for an individual who has the intelligence to be a much better reader, most commonly caused by a difficulty in phonological processing, which affects the ability of an individual to speak, read, and spell. &#160;<i>Phonological processing</i> means the appreciation of the individual sounds of spoken and written language.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><u>OTHER HEALTH CONSIDERATIONS</u></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The School Board shall prohibit, in accordance with statutory provisions, any teacher employed by the School Board from recommending that a student be administered a psychotropic drug, specifying or identifying any specific mental health diagnosis for a student, or using a parent's or guardian's refusal to consent to the administration of a psychotropic drug to a student or to a psychiatric evaluation, screening, or examination of a student as grounds for prohibiting the student from attending any class or participating in any school-related activity or as the sole basis of accusations of child abuse or neglect against the parent or guardian.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The provisions of the above paragraph shall not be construed so as to prohibit any of the following:</p>
