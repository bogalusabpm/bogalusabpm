<p class="Title">PUBLIC SCHOOL CHOICE</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>PUBLIC SCHOOL CHOICE</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Bogalusa City School Board is required by both Federal law and the Louisiana School Accountability Program to develop and maintain a <i>Public School Choice</i> policy for any school with a <i>School Performance Score</i> (SPS) below levels set by the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education (BESE).&#160;&#160;<i>School Choice</i> allows eligible students to transfer to an academically acceptable school.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Once schools eligible to receive students have been identified, a school-site utilization study shall be conducted as needed in all schools to determine the extent to which capacity exists to possibly accommodate students from schools offering choice, including students with special needs and/or students with disabilities.&#160;&#160;Only those schools that are labeled <i>academically acceptable</i> shall be considered eligible to receive students.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Superintendent and staff shall be responsible for developing and managing a <i>School Choice Plan</i>, which shall determine the schools to which students may transfer, which students shall have priority in transferring, and all other regulations and procedures for supervising school choice within the school district.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Notification</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Notification of parents of their school choice options shall be sent as early as possible, but not later than the first day of the school year for the schools that are required to offer choice.&#160;&#160;If there are no choice options available, this information shall be included in the notification sent parents.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Eligibility of Students</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>All students in a school required to offer choice shall be eligible to transfer.&#160;&#160;However, the School Board shall give priority to students from the lowest performing schools.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>LOUISIANA PUBLIC SCHOOL CHOICE</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Unless a violation of a court order, the parent or legal guardian of any student may seek to enroll his/her child in the public school of his/her choice, without regard to residence, school system geographic boundaries, or attendance zones, provided that:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>The public school in which the student was most recently enrolled, or would otherwise attend, received a school performance letter grade of D or F for the most recent school year, and<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The school to which the student seeks to enroll received a school performance letter grade of A, B, or C, for the most recent school year, and has sufficient capacity at the appropriate grade level.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board shall define “capacity” for each school, and determine a transfer request period which shall begin no later than March first and end no earlier than March twenty-eighth, annually.&#160;&#160;Prior to the transfer request period, the School Board shall notify parents and legal guardians of students enrolled in schools that received a D or F school performance letter grade of the following:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>The provisions of the Louisiana Public School choice policy;<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Schools under the jurisdiction of the School Board that received an A, B, or C school performance letter grade, if any;<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process for submitting student transfer requests; and,<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The page on the Louisiana Department of Education’s website that contains school performance data.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Transportation shall not be provided to a student who enrolls in a public school that is located outside the geographic boundaries of the School Board in which the student resides, if providing such transportation will result in additional cost to the School Board.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Superintendent shall be authorized to develop pertinent administrative regulations and procedures governing students seeking enrollment under the <i>Louisiana Public School Choice</i> section of this policy.&#160;&#160;Such regulations and procedures shall include entering into interdistrict agreements with other city, parish, or local School Boards to provide for the admission of students, and the transfer of school funds or other payments by one School Board to another for, or on account of, such attendance.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Enrollment under <i>Louisiana Public School Choice</i> shall only be for one school year, or applicable portion thereof if a student enrolls after the start of the school year.</p>
