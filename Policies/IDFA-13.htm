<p class="Title"><b style="font-weight: bold;">INTERSCHOLASTIC ATHLETICS</b></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">&#160;</p>
<p>The Bogalusa City School Board believes that the competitive athletic program is a part of the overall educational program of the school system.&#160;&#160;It also believes that the athletic program should be closely coordinated with the general instructional program of the school, and that the aims achieved through athletics should justify its inclusion in the overall educational program.&#160;&#160;The athletic program shall also be based on a spirit of non-professionalism so that participation is regarded as a privileged opportunity.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u style="text-decoration: underline;">ATHLETIC PROGRAM</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Interscholastic athletics may be made available for students in the schools of the school district.&#160;&#160;The Superintendent or his/her designee shall develop and maintain an athletic program in the school district that emphasizes participation of all students.&#160;&#160;The conduction of all athletic programs within the school district shall comply fully with regulations of the <a href="http://www.lhsaa.org/handbook/" target="_blank"><i>Louisiana High School Athletic Association</i> (LHSAA)</a> and policies of the School Board.&#160;&#160;The Board shall allow students to participate in as many sports activities and academic activities as he/she is capable of participating in without fear of reprisal.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u style="text-decoration: underline;">PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>No student shall be permitted to practice or participate in any interscholastic athletic program in any public school of the Bogalusa City School Board until such student shall have furnished to the principal of the school documentation that he/she has met the following requirements:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>Evidence of having had a physical examination by a licensed physician who shall have completed documentation as required by the Louisiana High School Athletic Association (LHSAA).<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Properly complete a <i><a href="http://new.dhh.louisiana.gov/assets/oph/pcrh/adolescent/SchoolHealthForms/schoolhealth1.pdf" target="_blank">School Entrance and General Health Exam Form</a>/</i><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt; font-style: italic;"><i><a href="https://www.lhsaa.org/siteuploads/editorimg/file/Forms and Resources/Medical_History-Medical_Exam(2).pdf" target="_blank" id="a111" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; position: relative; font-style: italic; text-decoration: none;" name="a111">LHSAA Medical History</a></i></span> and pass a medical examination by a licensed physician prior to the first time he/she participates in a sport in a LHSAA school.&#160;&#160;Physicians may continue to use the original <i>LHSAA Sports Physical Form</i> in performing sports physicals.&#160;&#160;In addition, parents shall be required to complete the <i><a href="http://new.dhh.louisiana.gov/assets/oph/pcrh/adolescent/SchoolHealthForms/schoolhealth5.pdf" target="_blank">Authorization for Release of Confidential Information</a></i><i>.</i><br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once a student passes the initial medical examination and completes an <i>LHSAA Medical History Form</i> prior to the sports season in which he/she participates, he/she shall annually pass any medical screening or medical examination required by a licensed physician and shall update his/her <i>LHSAA Medical History Form</i> as required.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A copy of all completed and signed medical examination and participation/release of information forms (and any others required by the School Board) must be on file at the school for every student before he/she practices or participates in interscholastic athletics during that school year.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An agreement signed by the student's parent(s) or legal guardian(s) to hold the School Board and its members, employees, agents, assigns and insurers harmless from and against any liability for any accidents involving the student while participating in such athletic activities and any injuries suffered by the student during, or as a result of, such participation.&#160;&#160;The agreement shall also authorize team physicians to treat the student in the event of an injury requiring emergency treatment.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students shall sign a form consenting to random drug screening and must obtain the written consent of their parent(s) or guardian(s) for said tests in order to be eligible to participate in any athletic or extracurricular activity. (See policy <i><a href="IDFAA.htm">IDFAA, Athletic and Extracurricular Activity Drug Screening</a>)</i></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u style="text-decoration: underline;">RULES VIOLATION</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Adherence to the rules of athletic representation and participation shall be strictly enforced by the Board.&#160;&#160;Any violations of athletic rules shall be immediately reported to the Superintendent by the principal.&#160;&#160;In the event that a member school, member school principal, or member school coach is penalized or cited by the LHSAA due to a violation, the athletic director, principal, and coach involved shall provide a full report to the Superintendent.&#160;&#160;If found warranted, the Superintendent in turn shall make a report to the School Board with pertinent recommendations for disciplinary action.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u style="text-decoration: underline;">SCHOLASTIC REQUIREMENTS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board endorses the scholastic eligibility requirements as a condition for participation in high school extracurricular activities as stipulated by the LHSAA.&#160;&#160;Scholastic requirements shall be as follow:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>To be eligible for the first semester of the school year, a student shall have earned at least six&#160;(6) units from the previous school year, which shall be listed on the studentâ€™s transcript, and shall have at least a "C" average as determined by the School Board when considering all "graded" subjects.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To be eligible for the second semester of the school year, a student shall pass at least six (6) subjects from the first semester.&#160;&#160;A senior attempting four (4) units in the first semester must pass all four (4) units to be eligible in the second semester.&#160;&#160;Likewise, a senior attempting five (5) units in the first semester must pass all five (5) units, and a senior taking six (6) or more units in the first semester must pass six (6) units for second semester eligibility.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The LHSAA includes specific eligibility rules for special education students which must be met for their participation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Individual schools or the School Board may set higher, but not lower scholastic requirements for interscholastic athletic participation.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u style="text-decoration: underline;">INSURANCE COVERAGE</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Athletes shall have either school student insurance or a signed statement from the parent showing that the student is otherwise covered for any accident or injuries that may occur during any athletic participation.&#160;&#160;No students shall be allowed to practice or participate in interscholastic athletics until this requirement has been met.</p>
