<p class="Title">FIELD TRIPS AND EXCURSIONS</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Bogalusa City School Board recognizes that educational field trips and excursions for instructional purposes help provide desirable learning experience. The Superintendent has the responsibility for the development of administrative criteria governing field trips and excursions. &#160;Only those field trips, however, that grow out of the instructional program or are otherwise related to the program are to be permitted on school time. Other trips such as those involving band and athletic activities should be confined to non-school time, except where the school is engaged in competition or a contest that requires use of school time.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Teachers planning on conducting field trips or learning experiences shall submit, through the principal, an application in writing to the Superintendent or his/her designee for approval. Before any trip or excursion is taken, written parental permission shall be secured for every student planning to take the trip. Students who have not submitted signed parental permission forms shall not be allowed to make the trip. Field trips must be approved prior to obtaining parental permission.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Before approval of any field trip is given, it shall be determined whether the trip is covered by the School Board's liability insurance. No travel shall be authorized where coverage cannot be secured prior to the trip commencing. Except in extreme cases approved by the principal of the school, private vehicles shall not be used for transporting children on field trips. &#160;Only buses, owned by or contracted to the school district and driven by certified operators shall be permitted, except as noted above. In such cases, a copy of the driver's license and a copy of the current insurance shall be kept on file at the school and submitted to the Superintendent or his/her designee.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board does not endorse the use of private vehicles to transport students to and/or from interscholastic activities. However, it recognizes the need for additional transportation at certain times; and the use of private vehicle may be utilized for the transportation of student to interscholastic activities provided that (1) student being thus transported provide the school with liability release forms signed by the students' parent/guardian; (2) all such vehicles are driven by properly licensed adults; and (3) the name of the driver, a copy of the driver's license, and proof of insurance coverage are provided the principal prior to the use to the private vehicle.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>STUDENT EXCURSIONS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Whenever any student trip or excursion utilizes the services of a travel agent or booking agent to provide or arrange for transportation or lodging, the School Board shall require the travel agent or booking agent to provide proof of adequate insurance and present to the School Board a surety bond sufficient to insure recovery of all monetary advances as a result of a nonperformance.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The amount of the bond shall beat least equal to any payments made to travel agent agency or booking agent prior to the date of travel. In addition, any bond issued shall be form a surety company licensed to do business in Louisiana and approved by the School Board. A certified check from the travel agency covering the full amount of advanced payment may be accepted by the School Board, but only when a bond is not available.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Additional regulations governing field trips or excursions for students that involve travel or lodging may be maintained by the Superintendent and staff.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The principal of the junior high, middle school, or high school shall be prohibited from approving any field trip or extracurricular activity promoted by any individual, organization, or entity which plans, promotes, or organizes travel arrangements, unless the trip or activity is in accordance with all School Board and staff established criteria, and is covered by proper insurance and an acceptable surety bond.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
