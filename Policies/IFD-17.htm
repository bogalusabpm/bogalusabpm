<p class="Title">PARENT AND FAMILY ENGAGEMENT</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p>The Bogalusa City School Board recognizes that parent and family engagement must be a priority of the School Board for children to learn and achieve academic success.&#160;&#160;Parents and families provide the primary educational environment for children; consequently, parents are vital and necessary partners with the School Board throughout their children's elementary and secondary school careers.&#160;&#160;The term <i>parent</i> shall refer to any caregiver who assumes responsibility for nurturing and caring for children, and includes parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles, foster parents, stepparents, and others.&#160;&#160;The concept of parent and family engagement shall include programs, services, and/or activities on the school site, as well as contributions of parents outside the normal school setting.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>It shall be the policy of the School Board and each public school in Bogalusa City, in meaningful collaboration with parents, teachers, students, administrators, and other educational resources, to establish, develop, and maintain strategies and programs that are intended to enhance the involvement of parents and other caregivers that reflect the needs of students, parents, and families served by the School Board, in accordance with applicable state and federal laws and regulations.&#160;&#160;As part of the parent and family engagement program, it shall be the responsibility of every school to create a welcoming environment, conducive to learning and supportive for comprehensive family involvement programs that have been developed jointly with parents/families.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>DISTRICT LEVEL RESPONSIBILITIES</u></p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Conduct, with the meaningful involvement of parents and family members, an annual evaluation of the content and effectiveness of components and strategies of the School Board's parent and family engagement program and assess the components' and strategies' usefulness.&#160;&#160;The evaluation shall attempt to identify ways of improving the academic quality of the schools served by the School Board, including identifying barriers to greater participation by parents in educational and parent and family engagement activities; particular attention shall be directed to parents who are economically disadvantaged, are disabled, have limited English proficiency, have limited literacy, or are of any racial or ethnic minority background.&#160;&#160;The School Board and each school shall use findings of such evaluation to design strategies for more effective parental and family involvement, and to revise, if necessary, the parent and family engagement policies and procedures.<br />
