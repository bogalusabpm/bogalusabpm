<p class="Title">SCHOOL WELLNESS</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Bogalusa City School Board (BCSB) is committed to the optimal development of every student. &#160;The School Board believes that for students to have the opportunity to achieve personal, academic, developmental and social success, we shall strive to ensure positive, safe and health-promoting learning environments at every level, in every setting, throughout the school year.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is BCSB's desire to ensure environments and opportunities for all students to practice healthy eating and physical activity behaviors throughout the school day while minimizing commercial distractions. &#160;Specifically, the School Board shall establish goals and procedures to ensure that:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<ul style="list-style: disc;">
<li>
<p>Students in Bogalusa City Schools have access to healthy foods throughout the school day —both through reimbursable school meals and other foods available throughout the school campus- in accordance with Federal and state nutrition standards;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students receive quality nutrition education that helps them develop lifelong healthy eating behaviors;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students have the opportunities to be physically active before, during and after school;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Schools engage in nutrition and physical activity promotion and other activities that promote student wellness;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>School staff are encouraged and supported to practice healthy nutrition and physical activity behaviors in and out of school;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The community is engaged in supporting the work of the School Board in creating continuity between school and other settings for students and staff to practice lifelong health habits; and</p>
</li>

<p>The School Board establishes and maintains an infrastructure for management, oversight, implementation, communication about and monitoring the policy and its established goals and objectives.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><u>SCHOOL HEALTH ADVISORY COUNCIL (SHAC)</u></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The BCSB shall establish a School Health Advisory Council (SHAC) to advise the School Board on physical activity for students, physical and health education, nutrition, and overall student health. &#160;The council members include parents of students and individuals representing the community, as well as school health and food service professionals. &#160;The SHAC shall assist in implementation, periodic review, and updating of the <i>School Wellness</i> policy.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Superintendent or his/her designee shall be responsible for assuring compliance with established district-wide nutrition and physical activity wellness policies. &#160;In each school, the principal or designee shall oversee compliance with those policies in his/her school and shall report on the school's compliance to the Superintendent or his/her designee.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">School food service staff, at the school or district level, shall assess compliance with nutrition policies within school food service areas and report on this matter to the Superintendent (or if done at the school level, to the school principal).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><u>IMPLEMENTATION</u></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The School Board shall develop and maintain a plan for implementation to manage and coordinate the execution of the <i>School Wellness</i> policy. &#160;The plan shall delineate roles, responsibilities, actions and timelines specific to each school; and include information about persons responsible for making changes; as well as specific goals and objectives for nutrition standards for all foods and beverages available on the school campus, food and beverage marketing, nutrition promotion and education, physical activity, physical education and other school-based activities that promote student wellness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This <i>School Wellness</i> policy and any progress reports shall be maintained on the School Board's website.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><u>TRIENNIAL PROGRESS ASSESSMENTS</u></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><u>COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT, OUTREACH AND COMMUNICATIONS</u></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The School Board is committed to being responsive to community input, which begins with awareness of the School Wellness policy. &#160;The School Board shall inform parents of the improvements that have been made to school meals and compliance with school meal standards, availability of child nutrition programs and application procedures, and a description of and compliance with nutrition standards. &#160;The School Board shall use electronic mechanisms, such as e-mail or displaying notices on the School Board's website, as well as non-electronic mechanisms, such as newsletters, presentations to parents, or sending information home to parents, to ensure that all families are actively notified of the content of, implementation of, and updates to the School Wellness policy and activities/initiatives. &#160;The School Board shall ensure that communications are culturally and linguistically appropriate to the community, and accomplished through means similar to other ways that the School Board and individual schools are communicating important school information with parents.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><u>ANNUAL NOTIFICATION OF POLICY</u></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><u>NUTRITION</u></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><u>School Meals</u></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Bogalusa City School Board is committed to serving healthy meals to children, with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and fat-free and low-fat milk; that are moderate in sodium, low in saturated fat, and have zero grams trans-fat per serving; and to meeting the nutrition needs of school children within their calorie requirements. &#160;See attached meal pattern requirements.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><u>Competitive Foods and Beverages</u></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The School Board is committed to ensuring that all foods and beverages available to students on the school campus during the school day support healthy eating. &#160;The foods and beverages sold and served outside of the school meal programs (e.g., "competitive foods and beverages) shall meet the nutrition standards as outlined in <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=c08d1071d8ff410f70492448aaf5e5d1&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se7.4.210_111&amp;rgn=div8" target="_blank">7 CFR 210.11</a>. &#160;These standards aim to improve student health and well-being, increased consumption of healthful foods during the school day and create an environment that reinforces the development of healthy eating habits.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><u>Nutrition Promotion</u></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nutrition promotion and education positively influence lifelong eating behaviors by using evidence-based techniques and nutrition messages, and by creating food environments that encourage healthy nutrition choices and encourage participation in school meal programs. &#160;Students and staff shall receive consistent nutrition messages throughout schools, classrooms, gymnasiums, and cafeterias.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nutrition promotion shall also include marketing and advertising nutrition foods and beverages to students as well as encouraging participation in school meal programs</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>

</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><u>PHYSICAL ACTIVITIES</u></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><u>Physical Education</u></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The School Board shall provide students with physical education, using an age-appropriate, sequential physical education curriculum consistent with national and state standards for physical education. &#160;The physical education curriculum shall promote the benefits of a physically active lifestyle and will help students develop skills to engage in lifelong healthy habits.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All School Board elementary (K-8) students shall receive physical education for at least 30 minutes per day throughout the school year. &#160;High school students are required to have a minimum of 1.5 Carnegie units in physical education to graduate.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The School Board physical education program shall promote student physical fitness through individualized fitness and activity assessments and shall use criterion-based reporting for each student.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><u>Physical Activity</u></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Students in grades K-8 are required by state law to receive at least thirty (30) minutes of physical activity per day. &#160;High school students shall be encouraged to incorporate physical activity into their day. &#160;A substantial percentage of students' physical activity can be provided through a comprehensive school physical activity program. &#160;Such programs reflect strong coordination and synergy across all of the components: quality physical education as the foundation; physical activity before, during and after school; staff involvement and family and community engagement. &#160;Schools shall ensure that varied physical activity opportunities are in addition to, and not as a substitute for, physical education.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline;">Each school that includes any of the grades kindergarten through five shall provide at least fifteen (15) minutes of recess, consisting of supervised, unstructured free play, each school day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">To the extent practicable, the School Board shall ensure that its grounds and facilities are safe and that equipment is available to students to be active.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><u>Classroom Physical Activity Breaks (Elementary and Secondary)</u></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The School Board recognizes that students are more attentive and ready to learn if provided with periodic breaks when they can be physically active or stretch. &#160;Thus, students shall be offered periodic opportunities to be active or to stretch throughout the day on all or most days during a typical school week. &#160;Teachers shall be encouraged to provide short (3-5 minute) physical activity breaks to students during and between classroom time at least three (3) days per week. &#160;Such physical activity breaks shall complement, not substitute, for physical education class, recess, and class transition periods.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The School Board shall provide resources and links to resources, tools, and technology with ideas for classroom physical activity breaks. &#160;Resources and ideas are also available through USDA and other organizations which promote health and wellness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><u>Active Academics</u></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Teachers shall be encouraged to incorporate movement and kinesthetic learning approaches into "core" subject instruction when, possible (e.g., science, math, language arts, social studies and others) and do their part to limit sedentary behavior during the school day.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The School Board shall support classroom teachers incorporating physical activity and employing kinesthetic learning approaches into core subjects by providing annual professional development opportunities and resources, including information on leading activities, activity options, as well as making available background material on the connections between learning and movement. &#160;Teachers shall serve as role models by being physically active alongside the students whenever feasible.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><u>OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT PROMOTE STUDENT WELLNESS</u></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The School Board shall integrate wellness activities across the entire school setting, not just in the cafeteria, other food and beverage venues and physical activity facilities. &#160;The School Board shall coordinate and integrate other initiatives related to physical activity, physical education, nutrition and other wellness components so all efforts are complementary, not duplicative, and work towards the same set of goals and objectives promoting student well-being, optimal development and strong educational outcomes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Public schools in Bogalusa City shall be encouraged to coordinate content across curricular areas that promote student health, such as teaching nutrition concepts in mathematics, with consultation provided by either the school or the School Board's curriculum experts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All efforts related to obtaining federal, state or other organizational recognition for efforts, or grants/funding opportunities for healthy school environments shall be coordinated with and complementary of the School Wellness policy, including but not limited to ensuring the involvement of the School Health Advisory Council.&#160;&#160;All school-sponsored events shall adhere to the School Wellness policy guidelines. &#160;All school-sponsored wellness events shall include physical activity and healthy eating opportunities when appropriate.</p>
