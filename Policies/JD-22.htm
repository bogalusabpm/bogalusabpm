<p class="Title">DISCIPLINE</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>It is the purpose of the Bogalusa City School Board to operate the schools in a manner that will provide an orderly process of education and that will provide for the welfare and safety of all students who attend these schools.&#160;&#160;The school's primary goal is to educate, not discipline; however, when the behavior of the individual student comes in conflict with rights of others, corrective actions may be necessary both for the benefit of that individual and the school as a whole.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Bogalusa City School Board shall endeavor to address student behavior with a focus on evidence-based interventions and supports, and to prioritize classroom- and school-based interventions in lieu of out-of-school disciplinary removals to address student misconduct in order to minimize the loss of academic instructional time.&#160;&#160;Every teacher and other school employee shall endeavor to hold each accountable for his/her behavior in school, or on the playgrounds of the school, on any school bus, on the street or while going to or returning from school, during intermission or recess, or at any school sponsored activity or function.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>To assist the teacher, the School Board shall establish regulations for the use of disciplinary measures within the schools and continually monitor and appraise their usefulness.&#160;&#160;Discipline shall be administered uniformly, consistently, and in a nondiscriminatory manner<i>,</i> in accordance with the School Board’s <i>Student Code of Conduct.</i></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Principals shall have both the authority and the duty to take disciplinary action whenever the behavior of any student(s) materially interferes with or substantially disrupts the maintenance of a proper atmosphere for learning within the classroom or other parts of the school.&#160;&#160;However, no student shall be disciplined in any manner by the School Board or school administrator, teacher, or other school employee for the use of force upon another person when it can be reasonably concluded that the use of such force more probably than not was committed solely for the purpose of preventing a forcible offense against the student or a forcible offense provided that the force used shall be reasonable and apparently necessary to prevent such offense.&#160;&#160;A student who is the aggressor or who brings on a difficulty cannot claim the right stated above to defend himself/herself.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Each teacher may take disciplinary action to correct a student who violates school rules<s><span style="color: #ff0000;"><font color="red">,</font></span></s> or who interferes with an orderly education process.&#160;&#160;The disciplinary action taken by the teacher shall be in accordance with such regulations and procedures established by the School Board.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Disciplinary action by a school employee may include, but is not limited to:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>Oral or written reprimands.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Referral for a counseling session which shall include but shall not be limited to conflict resolution, social responsibility, family responsibility, peer mediation, and stress management.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Written notification of parents of disruptive or unacceptable behavior, a copy of which shall be provided to the principal.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other disciplinary measures approved by the principal and faculty of the school and in compliance with School Board policy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>STUDENT REMOVAL FROM CLASSROOM</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>When a student’s behavior prevents the orderly instruction of other students, poses an immediate threat to the safety of students or the teacher, or when a student violates the school’s code of conduct the teacher may have the student immediately removed from his/her classroom and placed in custody of the principal or his/her designee.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any student removed from class in kindergarten through grade five shall not be permitted to return to class for at least thirty (30) minutes unless agreed to by the teacher initiating the disciplinary action.&#160;&#160;A student removed from class in grades six through twelve shall not be permitted to return to class during the same class period, unless agreed to by the teacher initiating the disciplinary action.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Whenever a teacher is struck by a student, the student, in addition to any other discipline given, shall be permanently removed from the teacher's classroom, unless the teacher objects, or unless the principal, with the concurrence of the building level committee, finds the striking incident to be entirely inadvertent.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Upon the student being removed from class and sent to the principal's office, the principal or designee shall advise the student of the particular misconduct of which he is accused as well as the basis for such accusation, and the student shall be given an opportunity at that time to explain his/her version of the facts. &#160;The principal or his/her designee then shall conduct a counseling session with the student as may be appropriate to establish a course of action, consistent with School Board policy to identify and correct the behavior for which the student is being disciplined.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Once removed, the student shall not be readmitted to the classroom until the principal has implemented at least one of the following disciplinary measures:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; vertical-align: baseline;">&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>Conferencing with the principal or his/her designee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Referral to counseling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peer mediation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Referral to the school building level committee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Restorative justice practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loss of privileges</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Detention</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In-school suspension</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span style="text-align: justify;">Out-of-school suspension</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initiation of expulsion hearings</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Referral for assignment to an alternative setting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requiring the completion of all assigned school work and homework that would have been assigned and completed by the student during the period of out-of-school suspension.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any other disciplinary measure authorized by the principal with the concurrence of the teacher or building level committee.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>Parental Notification</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The principal or his/her designee shall provide oral or written notification to the parent or legal guardian of any student removed from the classroom.&#160;&#160;Such notification shall include a description of any disciplinary action taken.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>When a student has been removed from a classroom, the teacher or the principal or his/her designee may require the parent, or legal guardian of the student to have a conference with the teacher or the principal or his/her designee before the student is readmitted.&#160;&#160;Such conference may be in person or by telephone or other virtual means.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Upon the student’s <i>third</i> removal from the same classroom, the teacher and principal shall discuss the disruptive behavior patterns of the student and the potentially appropriate disciplinary measure before the principal implements a disciplinary measure.&#160;&#160;In addition, a conference between the teacher or other appropriate school employee and the student’s parent, or legal guardian may be required prior to the student being readmitted to that same classroom.&#160;&#160;Such conference may be in person or by telephone or other virtual means.&#160;&#160;If such conference is required by the school, the school shall give written notice to the parent.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>For students who experience multiple behavioral incidents or disciplinary referrals, a principal or his designee shall consider a referral of the matter to an appropriate school building level committee.&#160;&#160;If the disruptive behavior persists, the teacher may request that the principal transfer the student into another setting.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>STUDENT MISCONDUCT AT END OF YEAR</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any non-graduating student who commits offenses during the last ten (10) days of the school year which carry recommendations for suspension or expulsion beyond the end of the school year shall have such recommendation extended into the next school year.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any graduating senior who commits a serious major or criminal infraction after the last regular class period as upheld by the Superintendent or his/her designee shall be excluded from year-end activities, including graduation exercises.&#160;&#160;Diplomas may be given or mailed to the student after the close of the school year.&#160;&#160;Seniors shall be made aware of this policy prior to the final exam period and a notice of the policy shall be mailed to parents from the school.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>PARENT CONFERENCES</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>In any case where a teacher, principal, or other school employee is authorized to <b>require</b> the parent or legal guardian of a student to attend a conference or meeting regarding the student’s behavior, and after notice, the parent or legal guardian willfully refuses to attend, the principal, or his/her designee, shall file a complaint, in accordance with statutory provisions, with a court exercising juvenile jurisdiction.&#160;&#160;<i>Notice</i> of the conference, specifying the time and date of the conference, shall be given by contacting the parent or legal guardian by telephone at the telephone number shown on the student’s registration card or by sending a certified letter to the address shown on the student’s registration card.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>REPORTS TO PRINCIPAL</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any teacher or other school employee may report to the principal any student who acts in a disorderly manner or is in violation of school rules, or any misconduct or violation of school rules by a student who may or may not be known to the teacher or employee.&#160;&#160;Incidents of alleged discipline violations shall be reported on the <span style="font-style: italic;"><i><a href="http://www.louisianabelieves.com/docs/default-source/public-school/2017-school-behavior-report.pdf?sfvrsn=2" target="_blank">School Behavior Report</a></i></span><i>/<a href="http://www.louisianabelieves.com/docs/public-school/form---school-bus-behavior-report.pdf?sfvrsn=2" target="_blank">School Bus Behavior Report</a></i> form provided by the Louisiana Department of Education.&#160;&#160;The forms shall be submitted in accordance with procedures outlined by the School District, the Superintendent, and school system personnel.&#160;&#160;The principal shall review and act upon such information submitted, to determine if suspension or other disciplinary action is necessary.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Should the principal fail to act on any report of misconduct or school violation, he/she shall explain the reasons for doing so to the Superintendent or his/her designee and to the teacher or school employee, student, parent, or legal guardian reporting the violation.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>DELINQUENT STUDENTS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Students who regularly disrupt the normal school environment shall be considered as delinquent, and may be reported by appropriate school personnel to the juvenile court.&#160;&#160;Any student that exhibits disruptive behavior, an incorrigible attitude, or any other discipline problems in general may be recommended by the principal for expulsion, assignment to an appropriate alternative educational placement, or transfer to adult education if the student is:</p>
