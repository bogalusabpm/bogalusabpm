<p class="Title">ADMINISTRATIVE RECORDS</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>School district records are public records and are available for inspection by any person at reasonable times during working hours.&#160;&#160;However, certain school documents, such as student school health records, student report cards, supervisory reports on teachers, budget worksheets, and personnel folders are in the category of privileged information and are not public records.&#160;&#160;Access to or release of privileged information such as student or personnel records, shall be governed by appropriate regulations and procedures.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Official records of the school district shall not leave the school or district premises except for official school business.&#160;&#160;Copies of school district records may be requested at any time.&#160;&#160;The Bogalusa City School Board shall require any person making the request to reimburse the School Board for the actual fees and costs incurred prior to providing any document, record, or item, unless the person is exempted from providing reimbursement.&#160;&#160;Duplication of records classified as privileged information shall not be permitted.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Any person may request in writing, a time to see such public records at a mutual, agreeable time with the office of the Superintendent and such time and place will be mutually stipulated during normal working hours.&#160;&#160;Any request to view records shall clearly state the specific records desired.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of law or rule or regulation to the contrary, a School Board member and any other person authorized pursuant to written policy of the School Board shall have the right to examine any or all records of the school system except school employee records relative to evaluations, observations, formal complaints, and grievances.&#160;&#160;However, the School Board, upon <i>a majority vote of the total School Board membership</i>, shall have the right to examine any or all records of the school system.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u style="text-decoration: underline;">EMPLOYEES' SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Except as required by applicable law, regulation, or policy of the Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education (BESE), the School Board shall not use the social security number of a teacher or school employee as a means of identification for such teacher or employee.&#160;&#160;The teacher or employee shall not be required to include or provide his/her social security number on any form or other written document unless:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li class="p">
<p>A social security number is required by any applicable law, regulation or policy of BESE; or<br />
&#160;</p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p>The form or written document is required for employment, retirement, application for leave or an individualized education plan.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board or any school official or employee shall not provide access to any form or document on which the social security number of a teacher or school employee appears to any person other than the following:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li class="p">
<p>Any official or employee of the school at which the teacher or school employee works, the School Board, or the Louisiana Department of Education, when such access is necessary for the performance of the duties and responsibilities of the official or employee.<br />
&#160;</p>
</li>
<li class="p">
<p>Any person authorized to have such access by the teacher or school employee.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u style="text-decoration: underline;">PRESERVATION OF RECORDS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>All persons and public bodies having custody or control of any public record, other than permanent records required by existing law to be kept for all time, shall exercise diligence and care in preserving the public record for the period or periods of time specified for such public records in formal records retention schedules developed and approved by the state archivist and director of the division of archives, records management, and history of the Department of State.&#160;&#160;In all instances in which a formal retention schedule has not been executed, such public records shall be preserved and maintained for a period of at least three (3) years from the date on which the public record was made.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>All existing records or records hereafter accumulated by the School Board, which participates in federal programs or receives federal grants, may be destroyed after three (3) years from the date on which the records were made in those cases where this provision is not superseded by guidelines for the operative federal program or grant requiring longer retention periods for the records in question, provided that these records shall not be destroyed in any case where litigation with reference thereto is pending, or&#160;&#160;until the appropriate state or federal audits have been conducted.</p>
