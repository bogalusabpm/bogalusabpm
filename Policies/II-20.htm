<p class="Title">TESTING PROGRAM</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The Bogalusa City School Board shall take every precaution to assure that all tests administered within the school system shall be conducted in such a manner so as not to compromise in any way the testing results.&#160;&#160;For criterion-referenced, norm-referenced, alternate assessments and certain other tests administered by or through the Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education (BESE), testing materials and procedures, as well as any electronic data, computer media, or passwords related to student testing, shall be properly supervised in strict compliance with regulations outlined by BESE and the School Board.&#160;&#160;In addition, all secure tests, answer documents, student log-in information, and supplementary secure materials shall be stored under lock and key in designated areas when not in use.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="color: windowtext; letter-spacing: 0pt;">Employees shall be responsible for reporting irregularities or improprieties in the administration of standardized tests.&#160;&#160;Although procedures for reporting irregularities to district personnel are listed below, employees may report such information directly to the Louisiana Department of Education (LDE), which shall investigate the allegations.&#160;&#160;No employee shall make a report of irregularities or improprieties in the administration of standardized tests knowing that the information included is false.&#160;&#160;No employee shall knowingly obstruct the procedures for receiving and investigating a report of irregularities or improprieties in the administration of standardized tests.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="color: windowtext; letter-spacing: 0pt;">No public school administrator or member of a School Board shall retaliate against an employee who in good faith participates in an investigation of testing administration improprieties or irregularities.&#160;&#160;Retaliation shall include discharging, demoting, suspending, threatening, harassing, or discriminating of an employee who in good faith reports testing administration improprieties or irregularities.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>DEFINITIONS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i>Access</i>—access to secure test materials means physically handling the materials, not reading, reviewing, or analyzing test items or student responses, either before, during, or after testing, except where providing approved accommodations.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><i>Secure Materials</i>―test materials that contain test items or student responses and to which access is restricted. &#160;Secure test materials include:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>student test booklets;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>student answer documents;</p>
</li>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The School Board, through the Superintendent and staff, shall develop an emergency plan and procedures that include steps to be followed in the event of an emergency that results in disruption of online testing.&#160;&#160;If online testing is disrupted by emergencies, lost internet connections, lost power, or computer crashes and students are unable to continue testing on the same day, the school test coordinator should document what occurred as a testing irregularity and notify the District Test Coordinator.&#160;&#160;If the student will be unable to return to testing by the end of the day after the disruption, the District Test Coordinator must immediately notify the LDE, Division of Assessments and Accountability.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><u>CONDITIONS AND PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS</u></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The State Superintendent of Education may disallow test results which may have been achieved in a manner which is in violation of test security.&#160;&#160;In addition:</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<ol start="1" style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>In cases where test results are not accepted because of breach of test security or action by the Louisiana Department of Education, any programmatic, evaluative, or graduation criteria dependent upon the data shall be deemed not to have been met.<br />

<li>
<p>Anyone known to be involved in the presentation of forged, counterfeit, or altered identification for the purposes of obtaining admission to a test administration site for any test administered by or through the State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education or the Louisiana Department of Education shall have breached test security.&#160;&#160;Any individual(s) or student who knowingly causes or allows the presentation of forged, counterfeit, or altered identification for the purpose of obtaining admission to any test administration site shall forfeit all test scores and will be allowed to retake the test at the next test administration.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test scores may be voided at the school level in cases of cheating or other violations of test security.&#160;&#160;When either cheating or the violation of test security is suspected, a committee to include at least the principal, school test coordinator, and test administrator shall be convened to determine whether or not a score should be voided.&#160;&#160;A written report documenting and describing the incident(s) shall be completed.&#160;&#160;In the event the decision is made to void scores because of cheating, the student and parents shall be notified and offered an opportunity for a hearing to be conducted by the principal with the test administrator and school test coordinator also present. &#160;The principal shall make the final decision regarding voiding of test scores or breach of ethics. &#160;If the decision is made to void test scores, the school test coordinator must submit a letter on school letterhead with the principal's and school test coordinator's signatures to the District Test Coordinator.&#160;&#160;Attached to the letter should be the written record of the breach of security or cheating, dates and times of all meetings/hearings relating to the incidents with signatures of all present at these meetings/hearings, and documentation of phone calls to parents.&#160;&#160;Any witnesses to cheating or breach of security should complete a written statement describing the incident and sign and date the statement. &#160;These should be submitted with the written report.<br />
