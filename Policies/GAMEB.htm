<p style="text-align: justify;"><u style="text-decoration: underline;">ENFORCEMENT</u></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In order to accomplish the objectives of this policy, the School Board reserves the right, at all times and in any work area, when circumstances warrant or reasonable cause exists, to conduct unannounced reasonable searches and inspections of School Board facilities. These searches will be conducted by authorized supervisors or search personnel, including drug detection dogs.&#160;&#160;The areas open to search include but are not limited to lockers, briefcases, desks, boxes, lunch boxes, tool chests, vehicles, and other employee's personal effects.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The School Board also reserves the right, in certain circumstances, to require employees to submit to medical or physical examinations or tests.&#160;&#160;These procedures may be required at any time as a condition of employment or continued employment.&#160;&#160;The procedures used may include, but are not limited to, urine drug tests, blood alcohol tests, breathalizer tests, or other medical examination to determine the use of any substance prohibited by this policy or to determine satisfactory fitness for duty.&#160;&#160;The tests may be announced or unannounced and may be utilized under the following circumstances:</p>

<br />
Any post-accident occurrence</b> on the job which requires the evaluation of a&#160;&#160;&#160;physician, or following a serious accident or near miss incident in which safety precautions were violated, or School Board property was damaged, may require drug testing of the involved individuals.&#160;&#160;Drug testing will be performed in accordance with pertinent regulations.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36px;">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36px;"><b style="font-weight: bold;">Reasonable suspicion</b> testing will be conducted when a supervisor has observed signs of possible intoxication or signs of using or being under the influence of prohibited substances, drugs or employee's physical condition or behavior leads the supervisor to have concern for the employee's safety or the safety and well-being of other employees or the public.&#160;&#160;All supervisory personnel will take part in a School Board sponsored training program to assist them in identifying and addressing illegal drug or alcohol use by employees or others while working.&#160;&#160;All drivers will undergo a substance abuse and policy education program.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 36px;">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 36px;"><b style="font-weight: bold;">Additional testing</b> and changes in these testing guidelines may be required because of obligations to meet changes in federal and state drug laws or to meet contractual agreements.</p>
