<p class="Title">STUDENT ASSIGNMENT</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Bogalusa City School Board shall have authority and responsibility for the assignment, placement, transfer, and continued education of all students attending schools within its jurisdiction.&#160;&#160;Students in the Bogalusa City School District shall attend school in the attendance zone in which they actually reside.&#160;&#160;Each student shall have only one domicile which is determined to be the place where he/she predominantly sleeps, takes meals, and maintains personal belongings, or when legal custody has been awarded by court of law, the principal residence of the parent awarded primary or domiciliary custody or by provisional custody by mandate, or if he/she is eighteen years old or has been emancipated by a court order, by the student's own domicile, if not specifically contrary to the provisions of an order of a court of competent jurisdiction providing for the assignment of students.&#160;&#160;However, the School Board reserves the authority to assign a student living in one school district to attend school in another district, if circumstances warrant.&#160;&#160;The parent or legal guardian of a student may file in writing to the School Board an objection to the assignment of the student, in which case the School Board shall review the assignment and investigate the circumstances in order to render a decision.&#160;&#160;Parents or legal guardians may otherwise obtain permission for a student to attend school in a neighborhood zone when the school is less than one mile from the student's principal residence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><i>Legal custody</i> is defined as the legal status created by a court order which establishes in a custodian the right to have physical custody of the child or minor.&#160;&#160;<i>Legal custody</i> shall also include cases where provisional custody of a minor student has been granted to a person of legal age by the child's parents, or the natural tutor, or grandparents awarded custody.&#160;&#160;Provisional custody shall be verified by submitting a properly executed and notarized form attesting to the granting of provisional custody for a period of time not to exceed one year.&#160;&#160;The school principal or his/her designee shall be responsible for monitoring the school enrollment list and shall immediately refer to the Supervisor of Child Welfare and Attendance the determination of proper school assignment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Any child temporarily residing within the district who has no permanent address or who has been abandoned by his/her parent, or who are in foster care, shall be enrolled and allowed to attend school in the zone appropriate to the special circumstance of the child.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">A student who does not actually reside in the geographical boundaries of the Bogalusa City School District shall not attend a school in the school district.&#160;&#160;However, if in the opinion of the principal, the child of an employee can enroll without creating an undue hardship in respect to overcrowding, or materially impacting the racial balance at the school, he/she may attend school in the Bogalusa City School District.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><u>Attendance Out of Zone</u></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Attendance out of zone is allowable whenever a mental or physical impairment, medical condition, or other exceptional condition requires services which are unavailable at the school in the child's regular attendance zone, provided that a student requesting transfer for medical reasons or extreme hardship and taking elective courses not offered at his/her regular school satisfies the following criteria:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>Transfers requested for medical reasons shall be verified by a physician's statement.&#160;&#160;Transfers requested for reasons of extreme hardship shall be verified by the Superintendent or his/her designee.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The parent or legal guardian must provide transportation.<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The transfer must not create an overcrowded condition.&#160;&#160;If overcrowding does occur, the School Board shall have the authority to shift students to another school.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When parents move from one district to another, the children may remain in the school in which they were registered if the parents so desire, providing such move was made after the children had attended said school for at least six (6) weeks.&#160;&#160;This is effective for the year involved only.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><u>VERIFICATION OF DOMICILE</u></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The principal shall be responsible for monitoring school enrollment and shall have authority to remove or transfer any student attending school out of district or out of zone.&#160;&#160;When investigating the domicile of a student, the School Board, through the principal, shall attempt to verify the <u>primary place of residence</u> (domicile) of the legal parent or legal or provisional guardian.&#160;&#160;Such verification of domicile shall be based on such items as the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<ol style="list-style: decimal;">
<li>
<p>Affidavit of residence, or<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certified copy of any judicially ordered tutorship, custody or guardianship of any minor child student not domiciled or in the custody of their natural and/or legal parents.&#160;&#160;Verification of the physical residency of the legal custodian, tutor/tutrix or nonparent shall also be required, or<br />
<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any other documentation as may be stipulated by the School Board.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><u>ASSIGNMENT OF STUDENTS WITH EXCEPTIONALITIES</u></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unless the <i>Individualized Education Program</i> (IEP) of a student with an exceptionality, except a gifted and talented student, requires some other arrangement, the School Board shall require the student with such an exceptionality to be educated in the school that the student would attend if he/she did not have an exceptionality.&#160;&#160;However, if the educational needs of the student cannot be achieved satisfactorily in a regular class setting, the student may be placed in an educational environment designed to meet the appropriate needs of the student, as determined by the IEP committee.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">However, a student with an exceptionality, except a gifted and talented student, shall be assigned to a school as requested by the parent, in accordance with La. Rev. Stat.

<br /></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The School Board responsible for the student and the respective School Board having jurisdiction over the school being requested by the parent enter into an agreement for the assignment of the student to the requested school.<br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">Student assignments in K through 8 will be made by the principal of the school with teacher input.&#160;&#160;The placement of a student shall be based on grades, achievement test scores, and participation in special programs and be made in accordance with the <i>Pupil Progression Plan.</i></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As soon as possible after the end of the student’s first grading period, the Superintendent or his/her designee shall review the initial placement of the child. &#160;If the Superintendent or his/her designee, in consultation with the school principal, the child’s(ren’s) teacher(s), and the parent, determines that the initial placement of the children is disruptive to the school or is not in the best educational interests of the child(ren), the initial placement of the child shall be modified, and the child(ren) shall be placed in accordance with School Board policy otherwise applicable to the child(ren).</p>
