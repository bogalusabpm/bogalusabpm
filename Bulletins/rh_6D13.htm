Bulletin 111― The Louisiana School,  District, and State Accountability System Chapter 1. General Provisions § 101. School Accountability A. Every school shall participate in a school accountability system based on student achievement as approved by the Louisiana State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education ( refer to R. S.  17: 10.1). B. Under No Child Left Behind ( NCLB)  the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 2001,  a state's definition of Adequate Yearly Progress ( AYP)  must apply the same high standards of academic achievement to all public elementary and secondary school students in the state and result in continuous and substantial academic improvement for all students.  Schools shall be judged on AYP through both the school performance score component and the subgroup component of the Louisiana School Accountability System. AUTHORITY NOTE: Promulgated in accordance with R. S.  17: 10.1. HISTORICAL NOTE: Promulgated by the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education,  LR 29: 2737 ( December 2003). Chapter 3. School Performance Score Component § 301. School Performance Score Goal A. A school performance score ( SPS)  shall be calculated for each school.  This score shall range from 0.0 to 150.0. B. Each school shall receive its school performance scores under one site code regardless of its grade structure. C. Preliminary school performance scores shall be released in the summer for schools that receive a letter grade of F.  Final accountability results shall be issued by the fall semester of each year and all accountability reports will reflect the configuration of the school as it existed the prior spring semester. 1. For K- 7 schools,  the school performance score will consist entirely of one index based on assessments and progress points listed in the table below. 2. For K- 8 schools,  the school performance score will consist of an assessment index,  dropout/ credit accumulation index,  and progress points. K- 8 School Performance Score Indices and Weights LEAP,  iLEAP,  and LAA 1 Grades K- 7 100 percent Grades K- 8 95 percent Dropout/ Credit Accumulation Index Grade 8 5 percent Progress Points Grades 3- 8 Up to 10 points 3. For schools with a grade 12,  the school performance scores will include four indicators weighted equally and progress points as outlined in the table below. High School Performance Score Indices and Weights End of Course Tests,  LAA 1 Grades 9- 12 25 percent ACT* ( Beginning in 2015- 16,  the ACT index shall also recognize WorkKeys. A concordance table comparing ACT to WorkKeys will be produced after the Spring 2015 administration.) Grade 12 25 percent Graduation Index Grade 12 25 percent Graduation Rate Grade 12 25 percent Progress points Grades 10 and 12 Up to 10 points * When calculating a school’s ACT index score,  students participating in the LAA 1 assessment shall not be included in the denominator of such calculation. 4. A combination school ( a school with a grade configuration that includes a combination from both categories of schools,  K- 8 and 9- 12),  will receive a score from a weighted average of the SPS from the K- 8 grades and the SPS from the 9- 12 grades.  a. The K- 8 SPS will be weighted by the number of students eligible to test during the spring test administration. b. The 9- 12 SPS will be weighted by the sum of: i. assessment units from students who are initial testers for EOC +  the students eligible to test ACT ( students with EOC and ACT will count only one time); ii. cohort graduation units from the number of members of the cohort used as the denominator in the graduation index calculation and the graduation rate ( students in cohort will count only one time).  5. For schools with configurations that include grades 9- 11,  but do not have a grade 12,  the school performance score will consist of the indices available. D. Progress Points 1. The school performance score will also be affected by the progress points earned from growth calculated for the non- proficient student subgroup ( i. e.,  super subgroup).  2. To be eligible for K- 8 progress points,  the school must have:  a. at least 10 students in the non- proficient subgroup,  as identified for subgroup membership based on prior year assessment scores only ( i. e.  students may be proficient or non- proficient in the current year)  in ELA or mathematics;  and EDUCATION Louisiana Administrative Code April 2015 2 b. more than 50 percent ( i. e.  50.001+)  of the students in the non- proficient subgroup exceed their expected score,  as determined by the value- added model for students in grades K- 8; c. if Subparagraphs 2. a and 2. b are met,  then the number and the percent of students will be multiplied by 0.1,  and the higher of the two products will be used to assign progress points.  For students who earn an unsatisfactory on LEAP or iLEAP,  the multiplier will be 0.1.  For students who earn an approaching basic on LEAP or iLEAP in the prior year,  the multiplier will be 0.05. 3. To be eligible for high school progress points,  the school must have:  a. at least 10 students in the non- proficient subgroup,  as identified for subgroup membership based on the most recent of the two previous years’  state assessment scores in ELA or mathematics;  and b. a minimum of 30 percent of the students in the non- proficient subgroup score at the top of the expected score range or higher,  as determined by the ACT series; NOTE:  EXPLORE predicts PLAN and PLAN predicts ACT.  As an example,  if EXPLORE predicted a student would score between 17 and 19 on the PLAN,  the student must score a 19 or higher in order to potentially earn progress points for the school. c. if Subparagraphs 3. a and 3. b are met,  then the number and the percent of students will be multiplied by 0.1,  and the higher of the two products will be used to assign progress points.  For students who earned an unsatisfactory on LEAP or iLEAP or needs improvement on end- of- course tests in prior year( s),  the multiplier will be 0.2.  For students who earned an approaching basic on LEAP or iLEAP or a fair on end- of- course tests in prior year( s),  the multiplier will be 0.1. 4. Schools can earn a maximum of 10 progress points to be added to the SPS. a. For combination schools that include both middle and high school grades ( e. g.,  6- 12),  the progress points shall be calculated by adding the points earned from each test group together.  For sums that are greater than 10,  a maximum of 10 points will be awarded. AUTHORITY NOTE: Promulgated in accordance with R. S.  17: 10.1.

Transition from Fall 2013 to Spring 2015 ( 2014 and 2015 SPS Release)  A. Schools shall receive an annual 2013 SPS using the 150- point scale,  as approved for the 2012- 13 school year and as described in Chapters 3- 6 of this bulletin.  B. 1. The LDE shall ensure that the distribution of school letter grades remains constant throughout this transition by assigning school letter grades for the 2013- 2014 and 2014- 2015 school years based on the distribution of school letter grades by school type ( e. g.,  K- 8 v.  combination v.  high school)  from the 2012- 2013 school year. a. If schools generally decline in performance scores,  then the distributions ( K- 8,  combination and high school)  shall remain the same as in 2012- 13 so as not to punish schools during the transition. b. Any school or district that maintains or improves its annual performance score as compared to the 2012- 13 performance scores shall not experience a decrease in its letter grade. Thus,  if schools generally improve in performance scores,  then the distributions shall improve as they would in any other year. 2. Prior to the creation of the transitional ninth grade,  some schools were categorized as combination schools,  rather than high schools,  simply because they offered 8th grade courses to a select group of students ineligible for 9th grade. Such schools shall be classified as high schools and the 12- 13 distributions shall be adjusted to reflect this shift. C. By the fall of 2015,  BESE shall determine,  in consultation with the Accountability Commission,  the timeline and benchmarks needed to gradually raise the standard for student proficiency such that the average student in a school or district with a letter grade of “ A” achieves at least “ mastery”  ( level 4)  on state assessments no later than the 2024- 2025 school year.

Calculating a 9- 12 Assessment Index A. All operational end- of- course ( EOC) tests will be used in the calculation of the EOC assessment index. 1. All subjects will be weighted equally. 2. The EOC performance level will be used in the calculation of the EOC assessment index as described in the chart below. EOC Performance Level Index Point Excellent 150 Good 100 Fair 0 Needs Improvement 0 3. EOC proficient test scores of “ good”  or “ excellent”  earned by students at a middle school will be included in the SPS calculations of the high school to which the student transfers.  The scores will be included in the accountability cycle that corresponds with the students’  first year of high school.  Middle schools will earn incentive points for all EOC test passing scores the same year in which the test was administered. a. Incentive points will be awarded as follows:  i. excellent =  50; ii. good =  25. 4. EOC test scores considered “ not proficient” ( needs improvement, fair) will not be transferred, or banked, to the high school. Students will retake the test at the high school, and the first administration of the test at the high school will be used in the calculation of the assessment index the same year in which it was earned. 5. Beginning with the 2012- 13 school year, students who are completing their third year in high school must have taken the Algebra I and English II tests, or LAA1. If they do not, the students will be assigned a score of zero and be counted as non- participants in high school testing. All students must be included in the assessment cohort regardless of course enrollment, grade assignment or program assignment. B. 1. The ACT composite score will be used in the calculation of the ACT assessment index as described in the chart below.  To the extent practicable,  a student’s highest earned score for any ACT administration shall be used in the calculation.

Starting in the 2015- 16 school year,  student performance on the WorkKeys shall be included within the ACT index,  where a student takes both assessments but achieved a higher score on the WorkKeys than on the ACT.  b. The state will produce a concordance table comparing ACT scores with WorkKeys scores at the conclusion of the 2014- 15 school year and the table shall be used to award points in the 2015- 16 school performance score results.

HISTORICAL NOTE: Promulgated by the Board of Elementary and Secondary Education,  LR 29: 2741 ( December 2003),  amended LR 31: 1512 ( July 2005),  LR 32: 1022 ( June 2006),  LR 34: 431 ( March 2008),  LR 36: 1991 ( September 2010),  LR 38: 3108 ( December 2012),  LR 40: 2507 ( December 2014). § 521. Pairing/ Sharing of Schools with Insufficient Test Data A. Any school with at least one testing grade ( 3- 11) will receive its SPS based only on its own student data provided it meets the requirements of § 519. B. Any K- 2 school with insufficient testing data will be awarded an SPS equal to the SPS of the school to which it is paired. C. Any school enrolling only twelfth grade students will be awarded an SPS based on shared data from a school or schools containing grades 9- 11 that send it the majority of its students.  This sharing relationship is to define the cohort that will provide the starting roster on which its graduation index will be based D. Any K- 2, 9- 12 configuration shall receive an SPS based solely on the 9- 12 data. E. Any ninth grade only school that does not administer an English/ language arts assessment shall be paired with another school that administers an English/ language arts assessment. F. A district must identify the school where each of its non- standard schools shall be paired in order to facilitate the proper sharing of data for reporting purposes, as described above. The paired school must be the one that receives by promotion the largest percentage of students from the non- standard school. In other words, the paired school must be the school into which the largest percentage of students feed. If two schools receive an identical percentage of students from a non- standard school, or when there is no distinct feeder pattern, the district shall select the paired school. G. Requirements for the number of test/ graduation index units shall be the sum of the units used to calculate the school's SPS ( see § 519). H. If a school has too few test units to be a &quot; stand- alone&quot; school, it may request to be considered stand- alone. 1. It shall receive an SPS that is calculated solely on that school's data, despite the small number of test units. 2. The request shall be in writing to the LDE from the LEAsuperintendent. 3. The school forfeits any right to appeal its SPS and status based on minimum test unit counts. I. Once the identification of &quot; paired&quot; schools has been made, this decision is binding for 10 years. An appeal to the BESE may be made to change this decision prior to the end of 10 years, when redistricting or other grade configuration and/ or membership changes occur. J. If 10 years has not elapsed, but a paired/ shared school acquires a sufficient number of testing units, then the pair/ share relationship will be broken, and the school will be treated as a stand- alone school.

Determining a Cohort for a Graduation A. A cohort of students is all students who entered 9th grade for the first time in the state of Louisiana in a given academic year. B. Each cohort of students will be tracked for four years,  from entry as first- time ninth graders through four academic years. Transitional ninth graders will enter automatically the first- time ninth grade cohort in the year after enrolling in transitional ninth grade. C. Students who exit Louisiana’s Student Information System ( SIS)  system in fewer than four years for legitimate reasons shall not be included in the cohort's graduation index calculations. 1. For graduation cohort calculations,  exit codes 07,  10,  14,  16,  and 20 from § 611 are legitimate,  along with any special codes created to deal with natural disasters. 2. Beginning with accountability decisions made in fall 2010 ( using 2009 grad data),  the only legitimate leavers from a cohort are those who; a. transfer from Louisiana K- 12 public education to a diploma awarding school or program; b. emigrate to another country; c. are deceased. 3. Specific documentation is required for students to be considered legitimate leavers. a. The only acceptable documentation for transfers to other diploma awarding schools or programs is a request for student records from the qualifying school or program,  or EDUCATION Louisiana Administrative Code April 2015 6 a letter from an official in the receiving school or program acknowledging the students enrollment.  The documentation must be clearly dated before October 1 following the student’s exit from the Louisiana Student Information System ( SIS).  The LDE can,  during data certification and audits,  require proof that the school or program is recognized as a “ diploma awarding”  by the state in which it is located. b. Documentation for a student transfer to home school is a school withdrawal form with parent signature and an LDE letter of approval to the parent, both dated before October 1 following the student’s exit from the Louisiana SIS. c. Students who emigrate to another country must be documented with a statement signed by a parent or a request for student records. d. An obituary or a letter from a parent is sufficient documentation for a deceased student. 4. The LDE shall maintain and post on the LDE website a list of schools that are considered “ non- diploma awarding.” 5. A school is classified as “ non- diploma awarding”  if it: a. awards fewer than five regular diplomas a year for two consecutive years;  or b. enrolls fewer than 10 twelfth graders for a full academic year for each of two consecutive years. c. the LDE can grant exceptions to these rules for new schools and schools with small populations upon district request if it can be determined that no circumvention of accountability consequences will occur. The district is responsible for providing any data requested by the LDE. D. Students that LEAs exit from a school or the LEA using anything other than legitimate leaver codes or those codes indicating completion of a high school course of study must subsequently appear in the Student Information System or they shall be considered dropouts from the state,  LEA and school. E. Students with no high school records in the Louisiana SIS who transfer from a home school,  non- public school,  or another state into a Louisiana school on or before October 1 of their eleventh grade year will enter the “ on- time”  cohort at the students'  assigned grade level. Students with existing Louisiana public high school records will re- enter their original cohort. F. Students transferring within the public school system in Louisiana will remain in their same cohort. 1. Students transferring within an LEA on or before October 1 of their cohort's fourth year will be included in the calculation of the graduation index at the school into which they transfer and complete their fourth year of high school. 2. Students who exit their high school for more than 45 calendar days during their fourth year shall not be included in that high school’s grad cohort calculation. G. Students who graduate or complete high school in fewer than four years will be included in the cohort in which they started 9th grade. H. Any student who exits K- 12 education to enter a school or program that does not award a high school diploma shall be considered a dropout in graduation cohort calculations. I. All students ( excluding those defined in C),  regardless of entry or exit dates,  are included in the state- level cohort. J. Students who exit K- 12 education and enroll in adult education shall earn points for their school and LEA only if a GED is awarded by October 1 of the following academic year. Otherwise,  the student shall be considered a dropout. AUTHORITY NOTE: Promulgated in accordance with R. S.  17: 10.1.

Chapter 7. Subgroup Component § 701. Subgroup Component Indicators A. Each school shall be evaluated on the subgroup component.  A school shall pass the subgroup component provided that each subgroup of students meets the subgroup component,  and the school,  as a whole,  meets the criteria for status or improvement on the additional academic indicator. 1. Passing the subgroup component: a. Participation rate test― 95 percent of the students within the subgroup participated in the standards- based assessments during the current year,  during the current and previous year averaged,  or during the current and previous two years averaged;  and b. Annual Measurable Objective status test ( AMO status test)― the subgroup percent proficient score is at/ or above the annual measurable objective in ELA and mathematics;  or c. Safe Harbor Test― i. the percentage of non- proficient students within the subgroup reduced by at least 10 percent of the previous year's value;  and ii. The subgroup improved or met the criterion on the additional academic indicator ( attendance rate for K- 11 schools,  and non- dropout rate through 2006 and graduation rate beginning in 2007 for schools with a twelfth grade). d. Beginning with the fall 2010,  the additional academic indicator for schools with a twelfth grade shall be evaluated using new procedures as required by the U.  S.  Department of Education published in High School Graduation Rate:  Non- Regulatory Guidance ( December 22,  2008). 2. 2002- 03 will be year one of judging schools based on the subgroup component. 3. 2003- 04 will be year two of judging schools based on the subgroup component. 4. For the non- proficient reduction portion of the safe harbor test,  a comparison of current year assessment data to the previous year assessment data shall be used.  For the additional academic indicator check for the safe harbor test and for the whole school check,  attendance and dropout data from two years prior will be compared to data from three years prior. Beginning in 2007,  a graduation rate shall replace use of the dropout data for the additional academic indicator. 5. To ensure high levels of reliability,  Louisiana will apply a 99 percent confidence interval to the calculations of subgroup component determinations for the: a. AMO status test; b. reduction of non- proficient students ( safe harbor test);  and c. additional academic indicator status analyses. 6. Louisiana will not apply a confidence interval to improvement analyses for the additional academic indicator. AUTHORITY NOTE: Promulgated in accordance with R. S.  17: 10.1.

Inclusion of Students in the Subgroup Component A. Students that meet the full academic year criteria,  as described in § 517 and as described in Paragraphs A. 1- 2 of this Section,  shall be included in all subgroup component analyses for the AMO status test and reduction of non- proficient students ( safe harbor test): 1. student is not exempted from testing due to medical illness,  death of the student's family member( s),  or the Title 28,  Part LXXXIII Louisiana A 9 dministrative Code April 2015 student being identified as LEP and in a school in the United States for less than one full academic year; 2. student is a former LEP student for up to two years after no longer being considered LEP under state rules. a. These students will not count toward the minimum n for the LEP subgroup. B. For analyses involving the additional academic indicator,  all students in each subgroup in the school shall be included. C. Each subgroup ( African American,  American Indian/ Alaskan Native,  Asian,  Hispanic,  white,  multi- racial,  Pacific Islander,  economically disadvantaged,  limited English proficient,  students with disabilities,  and all students)  within each school shall be evaluated separately on ELA and mathematics.  Students who are identified as Hispanic in one or more subgroup categories will be included in the Hispanic subgroup. 1. In calculating the subgroup component for a school: a. the alternate academic achievement standards for students participating in LAA 1 will be used,  provided that the percentage of proficient LAA 1 students at the district level does not exceed 1.0 percent of all students in the grades assessed.  If the district exceeds the 1.0 percent proficient cap,  the district shall request a waiver.  The students exceeding the cap shall be assigned a zero on the assessment and be considered non- proficient if: i. the district fails to request the waiver;  or ii. if the district requests the waiver but it is determined by LDE that ineligible students were administered LAA 1; b. when calculating the 1 percent cap for alternate assessment purposes,  all decimals in results shall be rounded to the next highest whole number; i. 1.0 percent of 628 students is 6.28 students.  The 1.0 percent cap,  in this instance,  is 7 students. 2. Students participating in LAA 1 shall be included in the special education subgroup. AUTHORITY NOTE: Promulgated in accordance with R.

AMO A. The annual measurable objective ( AMO)  is the percent of students required to reach the proficient level in a given year on the standards- based assessments.  Beginning in 2015,  English language arts and mathematics test results from grades 3- 8 LEAP,  iLEAP,  high school EOC algebra I and English II,  and LAA 1 will be used to calculate the percent proficient for the subgroup component ( for schools and districts). B. As required in NCLB,  the AMOs have been established based on the baseline percent proficient score ( proficient =  CRT level of basic,  mastery,  or advanced)  in English- language arts and mathematics in the 20th percentile school,  using the 2002 CRT test scores in ELA and mathematics for grades 4,  8,  and 10. 1. For proficiency levels see chart below. Proficiency LEAP/ iLEAP Basic,  Mastery,  Advanced EOC Good,  Excellent LAA 1 Meets or Exceeds Standard C. The AMOs for ELA and math are as follows.

A 99 percent confidence interval shall be used when evaluating whether subgroups within a school have attained the annual measurable objective ( AMO). E. A confidence interval is a statistic that creates a range of scores.  Subgroups with a 95 percent participation rate that attain a percent proficient score within or above the confidence interval range for the AMO shall be considered as having passed the subgroup component.  Confidence interval ranges are affected by subgroup size.  Smaller subgroups will have a wider range and larger subgroups will have a narrower range. AUTHORITY NOTE: Promulgated in accordance with R.

Using a Graduation Rate in the Subgroup Component A. As required by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001,  Louisiana shall calculate a graduation rate based on a cohort of students beginning in 2007. B. The definition of a cohort for this calculation is the same as that used in § 603. C. The additional academic indicator ( AAI)  calculation shall comply with High School Graduation Rate:  Non- Regulatory Guidance ( December 22,  2008)  published by the U.  S.  Department of Education. 1. For subgroup accountability purposes,  Louisiana high schools shall use an increasing target for the additional academic indicator. 2. For subgroup accountability purposes,  Louisiana’s high school annual targets shall increase annually as shown in the following table.

When two or more schools are created from an existing school ( e. g.,  grades 4- 6 &quot; split&quot;  from an existing K- 6 structure,  creating a K- 3 school and a 4- 6 school),  the LEA must consult with the LDE prior to implementing such changes to determine how the impacted schools will retain reward and/ or AUS or subgroup component failure status and any sanctions,  remedies,  and funds ( e. g.,  a 3- 8 school in AUS 3 should retain the AUS3 status in both schools if it is reconfigured into a 3- 5 and a 6- 8 school and if all grade levels contributed to its poor performance). After this consultation,  the LDE shall make all decisions regarding the effects of these changes on rewards,  AUS and subgroup component failure status,  and sanctions for all schools effected by the changes and will notify the LEA of its decision.  C. New K- 8 schools ( in existing LEAs)  with one year of test data shall be included in accountability.  For dropout/ credit accumulation data,  the district average for elementary schools will be used. D. The new high school in an existing LEA shall enter accountability using its first year of assessment data. 1. This adjusted assessment index shall be used as a first year SPS to assign letter grades. 2.

Reconfigured Schools A. Reconfigured schools are identified as schools that change grade configuration,  combine two schools with separate sitecodes into one school with a single sitecode,  or divide one school into two separate schools with different sitecodes.  Data collected at one site shall not be moved to another site and included in accountability results except when two or more schools with dissimilar configurations combine to create one school. B. Prior to any reconfiguration,  the LDE will review the changes to school sites in the planned reconfiguration and will consult with the LEA on the effects that the reconfiguration will have on rewards and/ or AUS or subgroup component failure status.  After this consultation,  the LDE shall make all decisions regarding the effects of these changes on rewards,  AUS or subgroup component failure status,  and sanctions for all schools effected by the changes and will notify the LEA of its decision.  Any AUS,  SCF,  or AA status and eligibility for participating in any specific programs shall be determined by the LDE. C. All reconfigurations must be submitted to the sponsor site database before October 1 of the first year of operation under the reconfiguration. D. High schools with a grade 12 that merge with a school without a grade 12 will retain its graduation data from the prior year. E. When a high school with a grade 12 merges with another school with a grade 12,  the graduation cohort outcome data from both schools will be combined together and recalculated. F. The LDE will consult with the district concerning the SPS calculation when unusual circumstances or configurations exist. AUTHORITY NOTE: Promulgated in accordance with R. S.  17: 10.1.

For any eligible student who does not take the test,  including those who are absent,  a score of &quot; 0&quot;  on the CRT and NRT shall be calculated in the school's SPS.  To assist a school in dealing with absent students,  the Louisiana Department of Education shall provide an extended testing period for test administration.  The only exceptions to this policy are students who were sick during the test and re- testing periods and who have formal documentation for that period. C. The LDE shall evaluate the accountability results each year to identify irregular data and unusual data results. 1. The LDE will select a sample of schools to investigate. 2. Districts shall be notified of the schools with irregular or unusual data that they must investigate themselves. a. The LDE will identify the specific areas of concern. b. The district will provide a written report explaining the irregular or unusual data within 60 days of notification by the LDE. D. If inaccurate,  invalid,  and/ or undocumented data is discovered and was or will be used in the calculation of school performance scores or subgroup adequate yearly progress determinations,  the LDE shall correct and/ or void the data. EDUCATION Louisiana Administrative Code April 2015 20 1. For example,  if four students in fall 2011 are coded as &quot; out- of- state&quot;  transfers,  it is determined in August 2012 that no documentation exists to support this exit code,  and the students are not found enrolled in another Louisiana school;  these four students will be changed to dropouts and counted as such in the 2012 accountability results,  and if applicable,  in the appropriate cohort for any graduation index calculations beginning in 2013. 2. In any instance where the inaccurate,  invalid,  and/ or undocumented data was used in a previous year's accountability results,  the LDE will evaluate the impact of the data and recommend to BESE any repayment of rewards or school improvement funds indicated by the recalculation of accountability results.

Each district shall be evaluated on the subgroup component at three different levels ( grade- clusters);  elementary ( K- 5),  middle ( 6- 8),  and high school ( 9- 12).  A district shall pass the subgroup component provided that each subgroup of students within each grade- cluster meets the passes the subgroup component,  and each grade- cluster the district,  as a whole,  meets the criteria for status or improvement on the additional academic indicator. a. Passing the Subgroup Component i. Participation rate test:  95 percent of the students within the each subgroup within each grade- cluster participated in the standards- based assessments;  and ii. Annual measurable objective status test ( AMO status test):  the subgroup percent proficient score within each grade- cluster is at/ or above the annual measurable objective in ELA and mathematics;  or iii. Safe harbor test: ( a). the percentage of non- proficient students within the each subgroup within each grade- cluster reduced declined by at least 10 percent of the previous year's value;  and ( b). the subgroup improved or met the criterion on the additional academic indicator ( attendance rate for the elementary and middle schools grade- clusters and non- dropout rate for the high schools grade- cluster). b. 2002- 03 will be year one of judging districts based on the subgroup component. c. 2003- 04 will be year two of judging districts based on the subgroup component. d. For the non- proficient reduction portion of the safe harbor test,  a comparison of current year assessment data to the previous year assessment data shall be used.  For the additional academic indicator check for the safe harbor test and for the whole grade- cluster check,  attendance and dropout data from the prior year will be compared to data from two years prior.  i. For 2005- 06 only,  the safe harbor comparison of assessment results shall include only English language arts and mathematics results from grades 4,  8,  and 10. ii. Beginning in 2006- 07,  safe harbor shall be determined using English language arts and mathematics assessment data from grades 3- 8 and 10. e. To ensure high levels of reliability,  Louisiana will apply a 99 percent confidence interval to the calculations of subgroup component determinations for: i. AMO status test; ii. reduction of non- proficient students ( safe harbor test);  and iii. status attendance/ non- dropout rate analyses. f. Louisiana will not apply a confidence interval to improvement analyses for attendance/ non- dropout rate. B. Inclusion of Students in the Subgroup Component 1. Students that meet the following criteria shall be included in all subgroup component analyses for the AMO status test and reduction of non- proficient students ( safe harbor test). a. Enrolled for the Full Academic Year ( FAY): i. at school level enrolled at the school on Oct.  1 and the date of testing; ii. at district level enrolled in the district on Oct.  1 and the date of testing; iii. at state level enrolled in a public LEA in the state on Oct.  1 and the date of testing. b. First administration of the test: i. only the first test administration will be used for the subgroup status and growth tests; ii. excludes summer school results and repeaters. c. Not exempted from testing due to medical illness,  death of the student's family member( s),  or the student being identified as LEP and in an English- speaking school for less than one full academic year. 2. For analyses involving the additional academic indicator,  all students in each subgroup within each grade- cluster in the district shall be included. 3. Each subgroup ( African American,  American Indian/ Alaskan Native,  Asian,  Hispanic,  white,  economically disadvantaged,  limited English proficient,  students with disabilities,  and all students)  within each district shall be evaluated separately on ELA and mathematics.  In calculating the subgroup component for a district: a. the alternate academic achievement standards for students participating in LAA 1 will be used,  provided that the percentage of proficient LAA 1 students does not exceed 1.0 percent of all students in the grades assessed.  If the district exceeds the 1.0 percent proficient cap,  the district shall request a waiver.  The students exceeding the cap shall be assigned a zero on the assessment and be considered non- proficient if: i. the district fails to request the waiver;  or ii. the district requests the waiver but it is determined by LDE that ineligible students were administered LAA 1; b. students participating in LAA 1 shall be included in the special education subgroup; c. LEP students shall participate in the statewide assessments; i. scores shall not be included in AMO or improvement in percent proficient calculations for LEP students who have not been enrolled in an English- speaking school for one full school year; EDUCATION Louisiana Administrative Code April 2015 22 d. when calculating the 1 percent cap for alternate assessment purposes,  all decimals in results shall be rounded to the next highest whole number; i. 1.0 percent of 1341 students is 13.41 students.  The 1.0 percent cap,  in this instance,  is 14 students. 4. Subgroups shall consist of: a. at least 10 students in order to be evaluated for the subgroup component; b. at least 40 students in order to be evaluated for the 95 percent participation rate. 5. Subgroups shall pass the participation rate test and either the AMO status test;  or the safe harbor test in order to be considered as having passed the subgroup/ component. C. AMO 1. The Annual Measurable Objective ( AMO)  is the percent of students required to reach the proficient level in a given year on the standards- based assessments,  which through 2005 will include English language arts and mathematics tests for 4th,  8th,  and 10th grades.  Beginning with Spring 2006 test results,  proficiency levels shall be determined using English language arts and mathematics assessment data from grades 3- 8 and 10. a. Proficient =  a score of basic,  mastery or advanced. 2. As required in NCLB,  the AMOs have been established based on the baseline percent proficient score ( proficient =  CRT level of basic,  mastery,  or advanced)  in English- language arts and mathematics in the 20th percentile school,  using the 2002 CRT test scores in ELA and mathematics for grades 4,  8,  and 10. 3. The AMOs for ELA and math are as follows. School Year ELA Mathematics 2001- 2002 2002- 2003 36.9% 30.1% 2003- 2004 36.9% 30.1% 2004- 2005 47.4% 41.8% 2005- 2006 47.4% 41.8% 2006- 2007 47.4% 41.8% 2007- 2008 57.9% 53.5% 2008- 2009 57.9% 53.5% 2009- 2010 57.9% 53.5% 2010- 2011 68.4% 65.2% 2011- 2012 78.9% 76.9% 2012- 2013 89.4% 88.6% 2013- 2014 100.0% 100.0% 4. A 99 percent confidence interval shall be used when evaluating whether subgroups within a grade- cluster within a district have attained the Annual Measurable Objective ( AMO). 5. A confidence interval is a statistic that creates a range of scores.  Subgroups with a 95 percent participation rate that attain a percent proficient score within or above the confidence interval range for the AMO shall be considered as having passed the subgroup component.  Confidence interval ranges are affected by subgroup size.  Smaller subgroups will have a wider range and larger subgroups will have a narrower range. D. Safe Harbor 1. Subgroups that do not pass the AMO status test by attaining a percent proficient score within or above the confidence interval range shall be evaluated for safe harbor. 2. Safe harbor is attained if: a. the subgroup makes a 10 percent reduction in its non- proficiency rate from the previous year: i. a 99 percent confidence interval is applied to this reduction check;  and b. the subgroup: i. achieves a 90 percent non- dropout rate ( 9- 12)  or attendance rate ( K- 5,  6- 8)  ( any LEA without a 12th grade shall use attendance rate).  ( A 99 percent confidence interval is applied to the 90 percent attendance rate and 90 percent non- dropout rate check);  or ii. makes at least 0.1 percent improvement in non- dropout rate ( 9- 12)  or attendance rate ( K- 5,  6- 8)  from the previous year ( any LEA without a 12th grade shall use attendance rate). 3. The non- dropout rate shall be evaluated for students in grade 9 and above. 4. Subgroups passing the participation rate test and achieving safe harbor shall be considered as having passed the subgroup component. E. Failing the Subgroup Component 1. A district shall fail the subgroup component if ANY subgroup within that ANY grade- cluster in the district fails the participation rate test,  the ELA or math AMO status test and the safe harbor test. 2. A grade- cluster district in which all subgroups have passed the subgroup component must also have the grade- cluster district pass the additional academic indicator: a. achieved a 90 percent non- dropout rate ( 9- 12)  or attendance rate ( K- 5,  6- 8)  ( any LEA without a 12th grade shall use attendance rate).  ( A 99 percent confidence interval is applied to the 90 percent non- dropout or attendance rate check.);  or b. made at least 0.1 percent improvement in non- dropout rate ( 9- 12)  or attendance rate ( K- 5,  6- 8)  from two years prior to the previous year ( any LEA without a 12th grade shall use attendance rate). NOTE: If a grade- cluster district in which all subgroups have passed the subgroup component does not pass the additional academic indicator,  it shall not pass the subgroup component.

One Year Waiver for &quot; Severe Impact&quot; Schools and Districts A. Schools that meet either of two conditions associated with disasters shall be labeled &quot; severe impact&quot;  schools and shall receive a one year waiver of accountability decisions based on the schools'  school performance scores.  The one year waiver is limited to the year in which the disaster occurred.  The conditions are: 1. the school was closed,  due to a disaster,  for 18 or more consecutive school days during a given academic year;  or 2. the school either gained or lost 25 percent or more of its testing population due to a disaster. a. This 25 percent gain or loss is calculated by dividing a school's prior year October 1 enrollment of students in grades 3- 11 into its current year October 1 enrollment of 3- 11 students exited using &quot; disaster&quot; codes or entered using &quot; disaster&quot; codes ( see § 4507). B. Schools that do not meet the severe impact criteria shall be labeled &quot; limited impact&quot; schools. C. Severe impact schools that receive the one year &quot; disaster&quot;  waiver shall not have school performance scores,  growth labels,  or letter grades published for the year of the waiver.  Assessment results will be provided to the districts for planning purposes. D. The year following the waivers,  the waived schools shall be considered new schools and shall enter accountability according to the policy in Chapter 33. E. Districts shall be considered &quot; Severe Impact&quot;  districts and receive a one year waiver from accountability labels and decisions if: 1. they are closed for 18 consecutive school days; or 2. they gain or lose 25 percent of their testing population before October 1; or 3. they have 25 percent or more of their schools granted a one year waiver or classified as new schools due to a disaster. F. Districts receiving a one year waiver shall not have district performance scores,  or letter grades published for the year of the waiver. G. Districts may elect to have severe impact schools: 1. remain fully in accountability and receive scores and labels as limited impact schools ( see § 4507 and § 4509);  or 2. receive scores and letter grades as limited impact schools,  but schools: EDUCATION Louisiana Administrative Code April 2015 24 a. will not enter or advance in school improvement or academic assistance as a result of accountability labels based on data collected during the year of the disaster; but b. schools can exit school improvement or academic assistance as a result of accountability labels based on data collected during the year of the disaster. H. Districts must provide justification to the LDE and receive LDE approval if they elect to: 1. have some of their severe impact schools receive the one year waiver and subsequent new school status,  while; 2. they elect for other severe impact schools to follow one of the choices in Paragraphs G. 1 and 2 above. I. Districts may request of the LDE that limited impact schools be relabeled severe impact schools if special circumstances exist at the schools. The LDE may grant the request if adequate justification is provided by the district. Requests that attempt to circumvent accountability for schools previously identified as being in school improvement shall be denied. J. Districts that elect for their schools the provisions in Subsections H and/ or I above,  must submit in writing,  by April 15 of the academic year in which the disaster occurred,  any such requests and any justification supporting the requests. K. Louisiana Department of Education staff will,  after conferring with district personnel,  notify in writing by the last &quot; business day&quot; in May,  the districts of its decisions concerning requests for the provisions in Subsections H and/ or I above. L. Districts must notify the LDE no later than the last &quot; business day&quot; in May of their final decisions regarding severely impacted schools and the choices in Subsection G ( above). M. Situations not considered by this policy but that substantially impact a school's accountability results may be addressed by the school district during the established appeal/ waiver period following the official fall release of accountability results.

Assessment Index Calculations with Displaced Students for Limited Impact Schools A. When student mobility occurs prior to October 1 of a given academic year as a result of a disaster,  the data collected during that academic year for calculating the assessment index ( for use in the SPS)  shall be evaluated in two ways: 1. as described in Chapters 3 and 4; 2. as described in Chapters 3 and 4,  but excluding the assessment results of any student who entered the school using a &quot; disaster&quot; entry code during that academic year. The assessment index calculated when excluding the displaced students is called the alternate assessment index. B. Letter grades shall be assigned and SPS reported using the lower of the two assessment indices,  except: 1. when using the higher of the two prevents a school from being labeled academically unacceptable,  the higher assessment index shall be used. C. The lower of the two assessment indices shall be used the following academic year in the SPS for reporting and assigning letter grades,  except: 1. when using the higher of the two prevents a school from being labeled academically unacceptable,  the higher assessment index shall be used.
