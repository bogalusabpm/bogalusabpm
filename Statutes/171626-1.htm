<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;(a) For those members who retired or died after May 26, 1972 but prior to May 13, 1975, or their beneficiaries, the benefits shall be increased by six percent.</p>

With respect to those members of their beneficiaries whose benefits are recomputed in accordance with Subsection A of this Section, the board of supervisors may make annual supplementary cost-of-living adjustments from interest earnings, the payments of which shall be effective as of July 1 of each year. Supplemental adjustments shall be based on the difference between the annual average all items consumer price indexes of the two immediately preceding calendar years. The supplementary cost-of-living adjustments shall be computed on the benefits as recomputed in accordance with Subsection A of this Section; however, no upward adjustment shall be made with respect to recomputed benefits which exceed ten thousand dollars per annum. The supplemental monthly cost-of-living adjustment shall not be increased or decreased more than three percent in any year, nor shall any such adjustment cause a reduction below the benefit as recomputed in accordance with Subsection A of this Section. The supplemental cost-of-living adjustment may be adjusted or suspended by the board at any time that it determines that the interest income of the system is not sufficient to pay for the supplemental benefits.</p>
