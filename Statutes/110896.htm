<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;A. If a person is employed in a position in which he should have been enrolled in this system on the date of employment but was by error enrolled in another public retirement system he shall have three years from the date of improper enrollment to transfer to this system if he is eligible for membership in this system. He shall make application to this system for the transfer within three years from the date of improper enrollment and the transferring system shall transfer all employee and employer contributions made on his behalf plus interest compounded annually at the actuarial valuation rate of the transferring system. In the event the amount of employee and employer contributions plus interest transferred are not sufficient to pay the total employee and employer contributions that would have been paid to the system plus the interest that would have accrued compounded annually at the actuarial valuation rate had the member been properly enrolled, the employer shall pay any difference in the assets to be transferred to the receiving system. In the event the amount of employee and employer contributions plus interest compounded annually at the actuarial valuation rate is more than that required to be transferred to the receiving system, the employee and employer shall be refunded the amount of the overpayment in proportion to their contributions. Upon payment of this sum all of his service credit will be transferred to this system.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;B. If a person is employed in a position in which he should have been enrolled in this system on the date of employment but was by error enrolled in another public retirement system and has been a member of such system for more than three years but is still eligible for membership in this system, he may transfer to this system but such transfer shall be totally governed by and be a transfer under the provisions of R.S. 11:143; however, if the enrollment error is the total fault of the employer, the employer shall pay any difference in the assets to be transferred and the actuarial cost to the receiving system in order to transfer all eligible service credit. In the event the amount of employee and employer contributions plus interest compounded annually at the actuarial valuation rate is more than that required to be transferred under R.S. 11:143, the employee and the employer shall be refunded the amount of the overpayment in proportion to their contributions.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;C. If a person is employed in a position in which he should have been enrolled in this system on the date of employment, but was not enrolled in any public retirement system, he shall become a member of this system. He may only establish service credit for the time he should have been a member of this system under the provisions of R.S. 11:888.</p>
