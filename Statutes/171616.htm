Any employee on authorized leave of absence when his election would otherwise need to be filed shall file such election within ninety days after he returns to active service. An employee who elects not to become a member as aforesaid may, nevertheless, later become a member as of the first day of the calendar month next following approval of his written application therefor filed with the board of supervisors, but he shall receive no credit under the funded system for service rendered prior to the time he becomes a member unless the board of supervisors permits the employee to make a lump sum payment in the amount he would have contributed plus appropriate interest, in which case his membership shall include such period of service.</p>
