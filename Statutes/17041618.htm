<p class="PdfParaStyle06">&#160;</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle06">C. The provisions of this Section shall not be construed to supersede any other state law, State Board of Elementary and Secondary Education policy, or city, parish, or other local public school board policy enacted or adopted relative to the discipline of students.</p>
