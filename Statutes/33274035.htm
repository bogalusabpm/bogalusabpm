A majority of the members of the board shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. The board shall keep minutes of all regular and special meetings and shall make them available to the public in conformance with law. The members of the board shall serve without compensation; however, they shall receive travel allowance as reimbursement for expenses incurred while attending to the business of the district.</p>
<p class="PdfParaStyle05">&#160;E. (1) The board shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, a plan or plans, such plan or plans, and the plan provided for in Subsection F of this Section, being hereinafter referred to, collectively, as the "plan", specifying the public improvements, facilities, and services proposed to be furnished, constructed or acquired for the district, and it shall conduct such public hearings, publish such notice with respect thereto and disseminate such information as it in the exercise of its sound discretion may deem to be appropriate or advisable and in the public interest. Any plan prepared by the board shall include provisions for marketing the district as an area for economic development incentives, providing for security of persons and property in the district, and a plan for the general beautification of the district as a whole.</p>
