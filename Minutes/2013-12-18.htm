<p>“First, I’d like to congratulate Mr. Adam Kemp as President of the Bogalusa City School Board, and I would like congratulate Mr. Curtis Creel as Vice President of Bogalusa City School Board.&#160;&#160;I passed out to you all a sheet.&#160;&#160;This was due to a meeting with the supervisors and myself, held on yesterday.&#160;&#160;You can look at the sheet and we will discuss it at a later time, but I just wanted you to be aware of what we are doing, and that we are working on that.&#160;&#160;Also, this is not going to be the end of the list, but I promised you on Monday night that I would, so, these are the things that we came up with as a group.&#160;&#160;The last thing is we are working on survival skills to keep the Bogalusa City Schools alive. We had a meeting on that also this week. &#160;The supervisors are here, and they can attest to this. &#160;We are coming up with some problems with solutions, and I’ll get those to you as soon as they’re completed.&#160;&#160;And finally, I would like to wish everybody a blessed holiday, and a prosperous New Year.&#160;&#160;The last thing I have in the folder; you’re going to have two (2) things.&#160;&#160;One is the Polar Express, All Aboard.&#160;&#160;It is going to be held tomorrow at the Northside Community Resource Center from 4:30PM-6:30PM, and you’re all invited to attend.&#160;&#160;The second thing in your folder is you know when we come back on January 6th, it’s not a day for students; it’s a Staff Development Day for the staff.&#160;&#160;This is what we’re going to do; I am trying to motivate teachers and staff members, so what we’re doing is we’re having a motivational speaker to come in.&#160;&#160;He is going to speak to every staff member that’s employed by the Bogalusa City School System.&#160;&#160;That’s all I have.&#160;&#160;Thank you,” concluded Superintendent Breaux.</p>
