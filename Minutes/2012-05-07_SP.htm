<p style="text-align: justify;"><b style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><font size="2" style="font-size:10pt;">Statement from Attorney Dale Branch-</font></span></b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><font size="2" style="font-size:10pt;">“You have some technical legal questions on where employees fit in these categories.&#160;&#160;Once they get in the category then there is a specific way to enforce the R.I.F. system.&#160;&#160;We don’t have those answers right now because some employees could fit in more than one category; and we’re trying to determine where those categories go; and where the employee fit.&#160;&#160;So, I guess that’s what you wanted me to say.&#160;&#160;So, we haven’t quite done that yet.”</font></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><font size="2" style="font-size:10pt;">Statement from President Kates-</font></span></b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><font size="2" style="font-size:10pt;">“Well Mr. Gholar as you know under the state law we can’t micromanage. The Superintendent runs the system.&#160;&#160;We’ve been asking this for a period of time. So it has come to the point now it either has to be done or we have to take action in another way.”</font></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><font size="2" style="font-size:10pt;">Statement from Mr. Gholar-</font></span></b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><font size="2" style="font-size:10pt;">“I know I’m not supposed to say anything; think about the people that are not certified; how they have to sit up here night after night and wait.&#160;&#160;That is just horrible.”</font></span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><font size="2" style="font-size:10pt;">At this point there was a comment from the audience stating, “That’s not fair.&#160;&#160;And Mr. Kates, Mr. Kates the system have R.I.Ffed before and it never took this long and it never had problems like this before.</font></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><font size="2" style="font-size:10pt;">Statement from Mr. Hymel-</font></span></b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><font size="2" style="font-size:10pt;">“I’m going to have to vote in a minute but I’m going to let y’all know, the only reason I’m going to vote the way I’m voting is because I was told just then behind closed doors that this would be done fairly; and it would be done exactly like it is on this piece of paper, and if it’s not, I promise you something is going to be done because we&#160;&#160;are going to do it right and it’s going to be fair; and if it’s not fair then I’m not for it.&#160;&#160;But that’s the only reason if I vote the way I do in a few minutes is because they promised me it was going to be fair and it was going to be just like it is supposed to be. We’ll have to see.&#160;&#160;I wanted to explain my vote before I do.”</font></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><font size="2" style="font-size:10pt;">It was motioned by Mrs. Duke, seconded by Mr. Hymel to approve the personnel agenda.&#160;&#160;The motion was not carried at this point.</font></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">At this point President Kates asked whether anyone had any questions about the agenda.&#160;&#160;A response from the audience was, “R.I.Ffing.”&#160;&#160;President Kates continued, “Well you will find that out May 14<sup style="vertical-align: Baseline;">th</sup>.”&#160;&#160;A voice from the audience continued, “You said that a couple of weeks ago Mr. President.&#160;&#160;It was the 1<sup style="vertical-align: Baseline;">st</sup>, then the 7<sup style="vertical-align: Baseline;">th</sup>.” &#160;&#160;“Well, all I’ve got to say is my Superintendent wasn’t ready,” replied President Kates.&#160;&#160;When the question arose about how safe were the certified teachers through the 14<sup style="vertical-align: Baseline;">th</sup> are for the next school year.&#160;&#160;“They’re for next school year.&#160;&#160;I know I didn’t make that plain, but they’re all for next school year; and paras; and she will have the contracts ready she said” replied President Kates.&#160;&#160;A question from the audience, “Are you saying that on May 14<sup style="vertical-align: Baseline;">th</sup> that people will know on that day; or will you all make decisions and then come back; and then we’ll know two more weeks again.”&#160;&#160;“We’re going to make that decision Monday night,” says President Kates.&#160;&#160;At that point Ms. Adams, Executive Secretary to the Board, brought to the President’s attention that May 14<sup style="vertical-align: Baseline;">th</sup> was Committee Meeting; and no votes are taken at a Committee Meeting.&#160;&#160;So possibly a Special Meeting will need to be scheduled.&#160;&#160;President Kates stated that we would have a Special Meeting following the Committee Meeting on May 14, 2012.&#160;&#160;There was another voiced concern from the audience.&#160;&#160;“Mr. Kates, the people who’ve been called in and told whatever they’ve been told are those people; are we still going with that, or are we starting over?” &#160;You can X that out.&#160;&#160;“You can X that out,” replied President Kates.&#160;&#160;Another voiced concern was regarding other personnel, Food Service, Custodians, Secretaries and others; and did they also have to wait until May 14<sup style="vertical-align: Baseline;">th</sup>.&#160;&#160;Another voiced concern from the audience, “Will we find out that night or will we have to wait to get a letter two weeks later in the mail to find out whether we have a job or not?”&#160;&#160;When questioned about the fact that some people have already been told about moves, President Kates stated, “All of that have to be approved. You can X all that out. &#160;They’re not moving, X it out.&#160;&#160;May 14<sup style="vertical-align: Baseline;">th</sup> is when we’re going to make our decision.”&#160;&#160;The conversation continued to gain clarity about decisions that had been previously made to move or let go employees.&#160;&#160;The response from President Kates was if they were certified they had a job.&#160;&#160;The twenty (20) day notification to those being R.I.Ffed was voiced.&#160;&#160;The conversation continued. President Kates addressing a citizen as Ms. Wilda spoke asking to let the Superintendent speak.&#160;&#160;&#160;President Kates stated, “I offered her to speak.”&#160;&#160;&#160;“We need to hear from her,” says Ms. Wilda.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><b style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><font size="2" style="font-size:10pt;">Statement from the Superintendent-</font></span></b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><font size="2" style="font-size:10pt;">“These decisions are not to be made lightly.&#160;&#160;I was trying to follow the R.I.F. Policy, and when I looked into some issues I realized I had questions that were not answered; and I called for legal and I did not have time to complete the decisions that I needed to present tonight, so legal will come in and work with me to make the decisions that needs to be made.&#160;&#160;I apologize to everyone; these decisions again they are not easy, and I am trying to be as fair and equitable as I possibly can.&#160;&#160;I am trying to make the decisions in the interest of this school district; and in the interest of our children.&#160;&#160;&#160;I realize that there have been lots of rumors; there’s been lots of misinformation out there; I apologize for that I cannot control all the rumors and the misinformation.&#160;&#160;I am truly sorry for that.&#160;&#160;It is never, never easy to share bad news; but I have been charged by this Board to make some reductions; and I am looking at that and trying to make the best possible decision that I can; but also I am trying to make it in accordance with legal directions.”</font></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><b style="font-weight: bold;">Adam Kemp-</b>“What you have to understand is that we put this into place months ago.&#160;&#160;I know that you’ve heard that already; we’ve asked for this to be presented to us tonight although the extension from the original dates to tonight. &#160;I think Mr. Walter you asked to make sure that we follow this policy.&#160;&#160;In my opinion the policy was not being followed.&#160;&#160;So in order to make sure that we are legal and fair and we follow what is written; in black and white we have to follow what is written we were not presented in my opinion what was following the policy; therefore we were asked to give one (1) week until the 14<sup style="vertical-align: Baseline;">th</sup> where legal can come in to specify some of our questions; questions that should have been answered but weren’t.&#160;&#160;We don’t want to act on something that is not legal and not following this contract; because as soon as we do, the first thing we’re going to hear is you didn’t follow this contract; so we’ve got to make sure as you say, our ducks are in a row and that everything has been looked at completely.&#160;&#160;I know we keep saying we don’t want to rush. We don’t want to rush.&#160;&#160;You’re right; you need to know what jobs are being affected.&#160;&#160;We did discuss that certified teaching positions; we did not consolidate schools; and so therefore we have the same number of students which are going to require the same number of teachers and if it’s certified teachers; if you have your certification or will have your certification by the end of this school year; you met all that criteria that we visited, we didn’t need to involve that in the R.I.F. policy.&#160;&#160;If I’m speaking wrong please tell me.&#160;&#160;So, we wanted to assure those people tonight.&#160;&#160;Now, we can’t micromanage, we have to go with what was presented; what was presented was not sufficient and so therefore we had to offer that extra time.&#160;&#160;On Monday, really there’s no excuse tonight; but on Monday there is definitely no excuse and if we don’t follow policy, the new policy says that’s terms for termination.&#160;&#160;So, we’ve got to look at what’s best for this system.&#160;&#160;We are trying our best by what’s being presented to us.&#160;&#160;Now we’re trying to also look at what was presented.&#160;&#160;It was less than ten (10) presented to us, I’m not going to say who; and if you were called in; and if that was something that was handled here at this office we have to act on it.&#160;&#160;Once we looked at it we had to make sure it was done fairly and it did not appear that way if we follow policy.&#160;&#160;So we’re going to make sure we follow the policy because we promised you we would; and if it takes seven (7) days to get extra assistance then we’re going to do everything we can, because just like in the system of teaching you get that intensive assistance and if you don’t get your result then you go through; that’s where we are, we’re giving that intensive assistance helping out as much as we can giving seven (7) more days to get it done&#160;&#160;right; and if it’s not done right then we look at what we have to do.&#160;&#160;There is nothing we can do as far as stopping at this point.&#160;&#160;We want to make sure that we follow the exact procedure that was adopted by this Board and presented by many of you out there who was on this committee.&#160;&#160;We had questions.&#160;&#160;Those questions couldn’t be answered; so therefore we were trying to get legal to come in and answer questions at a higher level to make sure that we’re covering every base so that no person is treated unfairly; any person that may be affected by the R.I.F. policy, they understand also why they met that category; and why that category was where we needed to cut.&#160;&#160;We don’t need to cut in certified positions.&#160;&#160;We do need to cut in other areas but we have to make sure that it is done fairly.&#160;&#160;Some of the names that were presented we could not get the information of where are the responsibilities of those jobs going to fall.&#160;&#160;I do thank Ms. Jenell coming in telling us how well our procedures were and how professional we were; and we want to continue that in every avenue. We are not giving in, I don’t want that reported.&#160;&#160;We are doing as professional job as we can as to what is being presented to us to protect everyone.&#160;&#160;So, we will know definitely by Monday.&#160;&#160;I apologize that you had to wait.&#160;&#160;We want to make sure we follow the policy that we promise you we would follow; and that will start at the supervisory level and work its way down, and will go by this policy.&#160;&#160;We do not reorganize and R.I.F., at the same time.&#160;&#160;We R.I.F. and then we reorganize with what we have left according to the policy.”&#160;&#160;“And that’s what we’re going to do,” says President Kates.&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">A question was asked was the R.I.F. policy changed at the last meeting.&#160;&#160;The response was, “No, it has never been changed. We have a copy of it.&#160;&#160;If you have a feeling that it has been changed, let us know; but to our knowledge it has never been changed.”&#160;&#160;“This is why we’re giving her an extension; we’re trying to abide by the policy,” says President Kates.&#160;&#160;“May &#160;I ask as a taxpayer, how long did you give the Superintendent to come up with this list of employees that need to know if they’re going to have a job in a month, not have a job; be here; be transferred to the….(Pausing and not completing this statement).&#160;&#160;How long did the Superintendent have for this?” “If I have to answer the question it’s been six (6) months,” says President Kates.&#160;&#160;&#160;“If any of these teachers didn’t do their job with their students for six (6) months would they still have a job?”&#160;&#160;Several different responses from the audience were “No.” The taxpayer continued, “Well why does she still have a job?”&#160;&#160;The in-depth discussion continued.&#160;&#160;“Now wait a minute now, I disagree on that as a Principal coming into the system there are teachers in this system and Ms. Jenkins and Pat Noto, y’all can vouch that they are still here because the leaders did not do their job. “As a taxpayer, not someone that draws a salary from this system; and you as a Board are charged &#160;with making sure that everyone from the Superintendent to any; to any&#160;&#160;Principal; to any teacher does their job and if they can’t do it, then they need to go.”&#160;&#160;“I can say this, I have said in open Board Meeting that when you don’t receive; if principals don’t give you the information and every employee have excellent evaluations; and we already know that every employee shouldn’t get an excellent evaluation we know our kids are failing, so that’s what’s going on.&#160;&#160;Some of them are failing; and some of our teachers are failing and not getting it done.&#160;&#160;Some of our administrators are not getting it done.&#160;&#160;Some of our Principals are not getting it done.&#160;&#160;With the state law School Board cannot get involved with the day-to-day operation, it’s her job.&#160;&#160;I’m just one vote.&#160;&#160;I have been saying a while back that we were not getting what we need.&#160;&#160;All I have to say is she asked for an extension, we’re going to give her the extension, May 14<sup style="vertical-align: Baseline;">th</sup>, it should be known” added President Kates.&#160;&#160;Someone asked, “What if there’s another meeting?”&#160;&#160;President Kates replied, “No, it won’t be like that.”&#160;&#160;Another question from the audience asked, “Paul are you all going to back her up when she makes the decision to lay off people or is it going to be my buddy or my&#160;&#160;church member or my friend?”&#160;&#160;“No it won’t be like that, it’s going to be by the R.I.F. policy.&#160;&#160;That’s why we didn’t vote tonight.&#160;&#160;We are going to abide by that policy,” concluded President Kates. From the audience a question was asked referring to the number of employees in Bogalusa City School District. &#160;&#160;The gentlemen voicing the question of concern stated, “If I understood you correctly, you said the only people that are going to be protected are the certified teachers.&#160;&#160;How many certified teachers do you have in this school system?”&#160;&#160;“We have a hundred and sixty eight (168) teachers but all of them may not be highly qualified,” replied Mrs. Walker.&#160;&#160;“You have a hundred and sixty eight (168) that are qualified, certified and are going to be protected; and you’re telling us, we understand from what I’ve been reading we have approximately four hundred (400) people in the school system; that approximately three hundred (300) of those people might be fired.”&#160;&#160;President Kates interrupted stating, “I don’t think it’s going to be that many.” &#160;The gentlemen from the audience continued, “I know it’s not going to be that many but you’ve got that many people that’s got to be sitting home tonight worrying about whether or not they are going to have a job.”&#160;&#160;“The reason they say I think three to four hundred (300-400) is because you have your Child Nutrition staff; you’ve got the custodians; you’ve got your paras; you got your (Pausing and not completing this statement),” says President Kates. &#160;&#160;The gentlemen continued, “None of those are guaranteed that they are going to have a job, only the certified people.”&#160;&#160;“You’re going to have paras,” says President Kates.&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><font size="2" style="font-size:10pt;">At this point President Kates reverted back to line item <b>7-B</b>.</font></span></p>
