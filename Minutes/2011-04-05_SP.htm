<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">There were no cards submitted, or no one to come forward</p>
<p style="margin-top: 12.0pt; text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">At this point President Kates resumed with the agenda.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">It was motioned by Reverend Mims, seconded by Mrs. Duke to approve.&#160;&#160;The motion was not unanimously carried, at this point.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;"><b style="font-weight: bold;">Statement from Mrs. Duke-"</b>Now I assume that they are going to give us bottom line price on that." President Kates replied, "Yes."</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;"><b style="font-weight: bold;">Question from Dr. Williams-"</b>Did they say eighty- five hundred, (<b>$8,500</b>)?</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;"><b style="font-weight: bold;">Statement from Reverend Mims-"</b>I thought it was eighty-five hundred (<b>$8,500+)</b> plus any other expenses.&#160;&#160;"About five or seven hundred and something (<b>$500</b> or <b>$700,</b> and <b>something</b>) she said, added Dr. Williams. "Not for the candidates huh, I mean for their travel right; for McPherson and Jacobson; but not for the candidates, just for the firm travel" asked Reverend Mims?&#160;&#160;Several responses were, "Right, just for the firm."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">The motion to select McPherson and Jacobson to conduct the Superintendent search was unanimously carried.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;"><b style="font-weight: bold;">Statement from President Kates-"</b>I’d like to thank all of our Board Members for helping us make this decision.&#160;&#160;I think this is a good decision for us; and I think we will get a top quality candidate out of this decision that we are making; and I think that it will help us move Bogalusa City School System forward; and also they pretty much said that they were going to give us a good selection and find a good candidate for us."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;"><b style="font-weight: bold;">Question from Reverend Mims-"</b>I have a question Mr. Kates, the group that we selected the other night…"<b>SREB</b>," interrupted <b>President Kates</b>.&#160;&#160;<b>SREB</b>, continued <b>Reverend Mims</b>, I wonder if somehow, whatever format that they are going to be using could somehow; I guess what I’m trying to say if that could be put together someway so that they too can kind of; I mean the people who are doing the search that they can kind of know what kind of system we are going to be using, you all see what I’m trying to say,” asked <b>Reverend Mims</b>?&#160;&#160;"I do," responded <b>Mrs. Duke</b>.&#160;&#160;"Integrating the Superintendent search with the new school format," added <b>Mr. Creel</b>.&#160;&#160;"Well, at the Organizational Meeting they will plan with us; and also, Scott told me that <b>SREB</b> they weren’t going to get involved with their training until we brought a new Superintendent on board, so they can&#160;&#160;get with them and let them know,” says <b>President Kates</b>.&#160;&#160;"What I’m saying is if the people who are doing the search; if they have some idea what kind of system we are going to be bringing in, that might be helpful &#160;for the kind of candidate that they would be looking for," added Reverend Mims.&#160;&#160;"I think that any person that applies in this system needs to know that we are doing this <b>SREB</b>; and needs to know basically what it’s all about,” says <b>Mrs. Duke</b>.&#160;&#160;”r;Well, I spoke with Ms.&#160;&#160;Dunn that we were getting ready to go into a <b>High School That Works Program</b>, with <b>SREB</b>,” says <b>President Kates</b>.&#160;&#160;"Well it’s good that they know that, so that as they are doing the leg work they can make a mesh with that kind of system," says <b>Reverend Mims</b>.&#160;&#160;"I brought this proposal to the table.&#160;&#160;I didn’t want to shove it down nobody’s throat or nothing.&#160;&#160;I just wanted everybody to take it and review it and look at it and see what their opinion was about it.&#160;&#160;I thought it would be something good for the system that we reach out.&#160;&#160;They would do a nation search looking for some one, where as we would just only get applicants probably from just out of Louisiana and Mississippi; and I felt that once every Board Member looked at it and reviewed what they was about, I thought that we would all get on board and see that this is the correct way to go,” says <b>President Kates</b>.&#160;&#160;"This Board knows how important the Superintendent is going to be so; we’re going to pick our Superintendent, we’re going to do our job, we’re just trying to get the best person possible&#160;&#160;to fit our needs, and do&#160;&#160;what’s best for these kids and these schools; and I honestly believe that we all are working together real good now and it’s going to get better; and the people we bring in we’re only going to be asking for help, because we know how important it is," says <b>Mr. Hymel</b>.&#160;&#160;"And, I’d like to say, I’ve been on the Board for two (<b>2</b>) terms and I’ve served on the Committee; and Reverend Mims I think you were on that Committee when we chose Mr. Payne; and we had like three (<b>3</b>) of&#160;&#160;us to go through everything; and then we picked out some; and then when &#160;Mrs. Horne was chosen, the whole Board read through everything and picked out the candidate; so I think this will&#160;&#160;be the smart thing to do, plus having the community members participate in this too; because I think it’s got to be a selection that the community has to have some involvement in," says <b>Mrs. Duke</b>.&#160;&#160;"You can buy in.&#160;&#160;I think Mr. Kates or somebody was saying that a lot of our businesses are supporting other systems athletically and I don’t know what other way; but we need our local businesses to be involved so that we can regain their support for our system.&#160;&#160;I think everybody on this Board is a product.&#160;&#160;I’m not a product of Bogalusa High <span style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">School but I am a product of Bogalusa City School System, from Central Memorial High School; and we had two (<b>2</b>) great high schools; athletically and academically; and we need to have one (<b>1</b>) again. That’s what we’re looking for to have a system that is looked at all over the State of Louisiana,” says <b>Reverend Mims</b>.&#160;&#160;”r;On that note Reverend Mims, I think we all want to be positive;&#160;&#160;and thankful for these community members that have volunteered their time to participate in this selection process; but getting back to that time when you were in school and I was too Reverend Mims, we didn’t have this program and that program, we had parents that cared for us; and we had discipline and respect for authority in the school&#160;&#160;system; and I still say whichever system we use and whichever Superintendent we have&#160;&#160;those basic principles are still going to have to be employed; discipline and respect for authority; and in that order; and then we can get some knowledge in these kids," says <b>Dr. Williams</b>.&#160;&#160;"I just want everybody to realize that we’re not running from nothing and it’s not more work, but I tell you most of us will be here at any time.&#160;&#160;If we have to meet with those people, we’re not trying to get out of being here two or three days a week or whatever it takes to get the&#160;&#160;right person, we’re willing to do that.&#160;&#160;We’re doing what we think is best for this system," says <b>Mr. Hymel</b>.&#160;&#160;"We tried it the other way.... (Interrupted by Mr. Hymel), says <b>Mrs. Duke</b>.&#160;&#160;”r;Like I said, I can come up here every day if I have to, that’s no problem, we just have to get the best person,” continued <b>Mr. Hymel</b>.&#160;&#160;&#160;"This Board is going to make that decision," added <b>Reverend Mims</b>.</span></p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;"><b style="font-weight: bold;"><u style="text-decoration: underline;">7.)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Interim Superintendent Comments-</u></b><u>Stephanie Hoppen</u></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">"I agree with what you say here tonight; and I think that’s what that company does, they look for Superintendents.&#160;&#160;Mr. Hymel said that he could come up here but still, if you have a company that will do that; and find a good pool that will fit, then you all have that final selection to choose; I mean it will be a selection that you can make a whole lot easier, than to spend time going out looking trying to find somebody that’s suitable.&#160;&#160;That’s their job; that’s what they do; and I think it’s a good thing and I think it’s going to work out well in helping us find somebody to lead our district," says Interim Superintendent Hoppen.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">When Mrs. Duke a question was posed regarding extension of the applications and those already received by the district prior to the selection of the consulting firm, <b>President Kates</b> stated, "They will look at all the applicants that we already have accepted.&#160;&#160;I had Ms. Dunn to talk with Mrs. Dillman; and they had a conversation and they have been conversing; so they will look at the applications we already have accepted.&#160;&#160;They will be put in that pool too."&#160;&#160;For clarity, <b>Reverend Mims</b> asked, "Their search will be in their database nationwide; and they will consider people that applied to our advertisement."&#160;&#160;"Correct,” replied <b>President Kates</b> and <b>Mrs. Dillman</b>.&#160;&#160;"We will not be required to repost in any of the newspapers that we have posted already.&#160;&#160;They will post on their website as well other media that they choose to assist with getting us a pool of applicants.&#160;&#160;And yes, they will consider; we have nine (<b>9</b>) applicants that applied; they will consider each one of them.&#160;&#160;They may have the applicants reapply through their procedures; but they will contact each one of the applicants and take care of that process," added Mrs. Dillman.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;"><b style="font-weight: bold;"><u style="text-decoration: underline;">8.)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Board Members Comments</u></b></p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;"><b style="font-weight: bold;"><u style="text-decoration: underline;">Mrs. Eleanor Duke</u></b>-"I’d like to say something.&#160;&#160;Reverend Mims, Mr. Creel and Mr. Hymel and I went to Pleasant Hill this morning for sort of a little Pep Rally for the LEAP test; and each class presented a little yell they had done; and they were all so enthusiastic; I was so proud of them.&#160;&#160;And I say, 'Go Pleasant Hill,' you all did a good job."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;"><b style="font-weight: bold;"><u style="text-decoration: underline;">Mr. Calvin Hymel-</u></b> "I’ve just got to say that my vote for the Superintendent will be somebody that will represent everybody equal and treat&#160;&#160;everybody the same; it won’t have no special interest group; it’s going to be somebody that is for kids; and for every teacher, janitor, bus driver, whatever.&#160;&#160;I want somebody that will treat everybody the same."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">At that point Ms. Adams brought to the Boards attention the Legislative Breakfast that will be held on <b>Monday, April 18, 2011</b> at the St. Tammany Parish School Board Office in Covington.&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">"Mrs. Walker stated, "In your yellow folder Mr. Kates has authorized me to work with <b>SREB</b> on the cost so the cost will be less stringent on the General Fund."&#160;&#160;Other means were mentioned as a means of support for this endeavor, such as Title I, Title II, and the Gates Foundation.&#160;&#160;She also stated that the cost will be spread across the three (<b>3</b>) years, not all at once and would be less due to Northside Technology School being removed in the cost.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;"><b style="font-weight: bold;"><u style="text-decoration: underline;">Mr. Curtis Creel</u></b>-"Monday morning Reverend Mims and I attended the preconstruction conference at Bogalusa High School concerning the renovation in the auditorium; and it appears to me from the way we went, that everyone is on line; and standing in line waiting to get to work.&#160;&#160;They were reasonably confident that the forty-five (<b>45</b>) day deadline would be met.&#160;&#160;They actually encouraged everyone involved to work toward finishing the project prior to that.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;"><b style="font-weight: bold;"><u style="text-decoration: underline;">President Mr. Paul Kates</u></b>-"I would like to thank everybody for supporting this venture that we’re on.&#160;&#160;I believe we’re going in the right direction; well I don’t believe; I know we’re going in the right direction."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="font-size: 10pt;">President Kates asked if there were any more comments.&#160;&#160;There were none, and he adjourned.</p>
