</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">"Thank you.&#160;&#160;Good evening Board Members, Superintendent and guest.&#160;&#160;We’re here tonight to present the School Wellness Policy which, we’ve been working on since the beginning of the school year.&#160;&#160;We initially had a School Wellness Policy starting back in 2006; and this will be the second revision.&#160;&#160;This is just one of our meetings where Dr. Berenson attended with us. &#160;Our vision for our School Health Advisory, which is the council that is working on the School Wellness Policy; and doing other things in our community and in the schools; our vision is:&#160;&#160;'Enhancing our children’s physical and mental well being through physical activities, healthy eating habits and a tobacco free life style.' What we want to do with this School Wellness Policy is, connect wellness to academics.&#160;&#160;Sometimes people don’t see the connection; but there’s definitely a connection.&#160;&#160;And our action plans begin with a grant that we were awarded at the start of this school yea called <b>Louisiana Schools Putting Prevention to Work</b>.&#160;&#160;Our goal is to be compliant with <b>Louisiana Act 286</b>, in developing a School Health Advisory Council; we call it our <b>SHAC</b>, and to advance the level of the implementation of the federally mandated <b>School Wellness Policy</b>, to improve the health of our students through healthy eating, physical activities, obesity prevention and tobacco prevention.&#160;&#160;Our first objective was, by October, present to the School Board a <b>Louisiana 100% Tobacco Free School Policy</b>; and we did that; and it is part of our Policy Manual.&#160;&#160;Our second objective was, by the end of this school year to revise the current draft of the <b>School Wellness Policy</b> and to present to the School Board for approval an implementation; and that is what we’re doing tonight with approval; and then we will begin implementing in the schools.&#160;&#160;And, thirdly, we want to implement and enforce the state mandated physical activities and healthy eating policy in all of our schools," says Mrs. Miller.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">Now, I’m going to introduce <b>Marsha Culpepper, RN</b>.&#160;&#160;She is a nurse with <b>LSU School Health Center</b>. &#160;She’s also on our health council.&#160;&#160;Mrs. Culpepper stated, "l went to a Childhood Obesity Conference in Baton Rouge; and what they do is, they go and collect a lot of data about our children.&#160;&#160;Louisiana got a "<b>D"</b> that’s not good; in physical activity and obesity.&#160;&#160;Our students are getting larger," says Mrs. Culpepper.&#160;&#160;She then began to give statics based on a graph illustration from the PowerPoint.&#160;"Our students have a problem.&#160;&#160;They are getting larger.&#160;&#160;Every month we get height; weight and calculate the <b>BMI</b>, just to get a grasp on what’s going on.&#160;&#160;Over the Christmas break we noticed that some of our students have gained anywhere from then (<b>10</b>) to twenty (<b>20</b>) pounds in a two week period.&#160;&#160;They don’t have enough of physical activities; they don’t get enough exercise.&#160;&#160;We have been doing this at the high school and the middle school.&#160;&#160;The high school was the first statics," added Mrs. Culpepper.&#160;&#160;Mrs. Culpepper stated that she did have statics from <b>2009-2010</b> and <b>2010-2011</b> school yea but they were not included in the slide presentation; and each year it keeps increasing.&#160;&#160;"As a result, we were working with Dr. Berenson on this and <b>HBO</b> came in and did a documentary on the Childhood Obesity epidemic that Bogalusa has.&#160;&#160;That’s pretty much it.&#160;&#160;They are not eating like they are suppose to; they’re not having the physical activity; and they are getting larger," concluded Mrs. Culpepper.&#160;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">Next, <b>Mrs. Lisa Murray, RN</b>, Bogalusa City District Wide nurse stated, "Actually at the beginning of the school yea this is just a sample of Denhamtown; this is the preschoolers.&#160;&#160;As you can see thirty-one percent (<b>31%</b>) of the preschoolers were overweight or obese; and at Superior Avenue, I did the same thing, this is one of the K-4; you can see this is kindergarten, forty percent (<b>40%</b>) overweight or obese; first grade, right at forty (<b>40</b>); second grade went down; but you can see third grade, it was close to fifty percent (<b>50%</b>). &#160;In one particular classroom at Superior, out&#160;&#160;of twenty-six (<b>26</b>) students, seventeen (<b>17</b>) students were overweight or obese; so that’s what we’re looking at; and then, progressively from&#160;&#160;the Middle School and the High School it goes up and up to about sixty-five percent (<b>65%</b>)," concluded Mrs. Murray.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">"Mrs. Miller continued stating, ’Okay, another part of&#160;&#160;our Wellness Policy is healthy eating and we have in place a <b>School Lunch Program</b>, a <b>School Breakfast Program</b>; a <b>Snack Program</b>; in the summer, a <b>Summer Food&#160;&#160;Service Program</b>; and I think at one of our meetings you mentioned that not only at Christmas; but over the summer maybe you found that they gained weight; so this may&#160;&#160;even show that they are not eating right at those times, because the weight gain increases during those periods when they are away from school.&#160;&#160;We also want to encourage staff and parents to participate in our program. With this policy we want to engage the entire community of Bogalusa to become a part of this; and that’s one of the reason we have business and community leaders on our council; because we want to engage the whole community.&#160;&#160;We also included competitive foods; and what that is, are foods and beverages offered outside of our Child Nutrition Programs. &#160;That would include concession vending, fundraisers, celebrations, rewards; all of</span> <span style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none; font-size: 10.0pt;">these things under this policy, will have to meet the criteria.&#160;&#160;Now, I want to point out to you, that we are not creating any policies that are foreign to the community; or to the state or even to the country.&#160;&#160;All these policies are mandated, we just wrote the policy so that it fits our community; and it will be an involving policy. &#160;We will be working with teachers, administrators, community members, our school health nurses, etc.; and also nutrition education.&#160;&#160;Our goal is to promote healthy food and drink choices; and by that I mean ensure that all foods brought in to the cafeteria meet the USDA nutrition guideline.&#160;&#160;The cafeteria is an extension of the classroom.&#160;&#160;This is a place where students can learn.&#160;&#160;They need to learn how to be successful in life and the cafeteria, is one place that they can do that; because they can learn how to eat properly; and it also involves social behavior, which is something else we want to strive for in the cafeteria.&#160;&#160;Kids learn to eat by how they are fed; so that’s why we have a <b>Breakfast Program</b>, a <b>Lunch Program</b>, a <b>Snack Program</b>, and a <b>Summer Program</b>.&#160;&#160;We want to have successful celebrations and fundraisers.&#160;&#160;Celebrations are important.&#160;&#160;It’s important to let the students know that we are proud of their accomplishments; so when we do that, there are healthy ways to do that.&#160;&#160;There are a lot of ideas in the policy that tells you suggestions; how to celebrate.&#160;&#160;&#160;Fundraisers are critical to our schools because the Principals need ways to improve their budget; and increase their revenues; so we know how critical fundraisers are.&#160;&#160;There is also a list of green fundraisers, healthy fundraisers.&#160;&#160;We want to ensure the <b>Healthy US School Challenge</b>.&#160;&#160;The HUSSC application is at the state department right now for Byrd Avenue Elementary.&#160;&#160;They have been working very hard this year on accomplishing being a <b>Gold School Award of Distinction</b>, hopefully that will happen, by the end of the year, I believe.&#160;&#160;When students are physically active they have fewer absences; research shows us that.&#160;&#160;They have fewer behavior problems, they have more ability to focus and they tend to score higher on their test," says Mrs. Miller.&#160;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">"One of the things that the grant <b>Schools Putting Prevention to Work</b> did was provide us funding to buy new equipment in all of our schools; and we’ve done that; and I think it’s about fifteen thousand dollars (<b>$15,000</b>) that we’ve put into the schools in the Health and P.E. classrooms this yea and I think it’s a wonderful opportunity for both the teachers and the students,” says Mrs. Miller.&#160;&#160;At that point, she mentioned some of the equipment that were provided through the grant, such as mats, hoola-hoops in the yard, she thought maybe weights in the yard, just to name a few.&#160;&#160;Mrs. Miller then called on <b>Nancy Gonzales</b>, Health and P.E. Instructor at Pleasant Hill Elementary School to share with the Board some of the things that she does with her class.&#160;&#160;Ms. Gonzales stated, ”I have been trying to put together a program; a six-week program where they use weights; and teaching them which muscles are working when they are using the weights; so the mats are actually being used for yoga and for sit-ups and push-ups; and I’m explaining to them what muscles they are using when they’re using the weights; and also explain to them the difference between cardiovascular endurance and muscular endurance. &#160;So, hopefully when they get older they will continue to follow those patterns,” says Ms. Gonzales.&#160;&#160;Next Mrs. Miller asked her to tell them about her "Report Card." Ms. Gonzales went on to say, "This is just a little program that I put together when I was teaching them how many steps and how many repetitions of certain exercises they can do every time they are working on that muscle." Mrs. Miller mentioned that there were some students of Ms. Gonzales class that were there. ”I would like to add that what we’re seeing too with these high <b>BMIs</b> with our students is also high blood pressure.&#160;&#160;High blood pressure goes along with the high <b>BMIs</b>; we’re also having students that are coming back for Type 2 diabetes.&#160;&#160;All of that can be controlled with exercising and eating right,” says Mrs. Culpepper.&#160;&#160;"Okay, that’s all we have unless you have any questions for any of the <b>SHAC</b> members.&#160;&#160;I’d like to have the <b>SHAC</b> members that are present to stand up so you can get an idea of who’s here. &#160;Also, Eleanor Duke and of course Ruth Horne, these are part of the members; and Stevie Hoppen. &#160;That’s all I have for right now.&#160;&#160;Thank you," concluded Mrs. Miller. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">At this point Mrs. Duke posed a question to the alternative to selling snicker bars and that sort of thing, for fundraisers.&#160;&#160;Mrs. Miller replied, "It is difficult, and that’s why I sent to all the Principals… (Pausing and not completing the statement).&#160;&#160;In the back of this policy it talks about different ways to do snacks and parties and; then fundraisers like <b>Sports Tournament</b>; have some type of tournament where the kids are actually involved in doing something; like <b>Fun Run</b> and things like that, that can involve physical activities, <b>Spring Yard Work</b>, <b>Community Job Fairs</b>, <b>Craft Fairs</b>, sell <b>Seat Cushions</b>, <b>Raffles</b>, which the schools already do; selling <b>Buttons, Gift Wrap Paper, Pens, Magazines</b>, <b>Frisbees</b>, those sort of things," replied &#160;Mrs. Miller.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; text-autospace: none;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">"I’m Debbie Craig and this is Tonda Collett from the Special Ed Department and we’re here tonight to report on our recent monitoring findings.&#160;&#160;I’m going to briefly go through what the findings were; and then Mrs.&#160;&#160;Collett is going to go a little bit more into detail on it.&#160;&#160;The Department of Education conducted a focused, on-site compliance monitoring of the Special Education Program during the <b>2009-2010 School Yea</b> and there were findings of non-compliance in the area <b>FAPE</b>, which stands for <b>Free and Appropriate Public Education</b> and <b>Transition Services</b>.&#160;&#160;We were required to submit a <b>Corrective Action Plan</b>, which we did and we implemented. &#160;We just turned in our final packet of that, this month.&#160;&#160;They did a follow-up visit on November 29<sup>th</sup> through December 1<sup>st</sup> of last year to look at the effectiveness of our <b>Corrective Action Plan</b>; and they found that even though we had made improvements, we still had not done enough; and they still found some continued non-compliance in the area of <b>FAPE</b>.&#160;&#160;Because of that, we have submitted another plan which has been approved and we are currently implementing it.&#160;&#160;The activities included in this plan are:&#160;&#160;<b>1</b>.) We are revising <b>IEPs</b> to correct the specific findings of the students of the folders that they monitored; <b>2</b>.) We will offer compensatory education for those students at <b>Bogalusa Middle School</b> this summe <b>3</b>.) We’re providing on-going professional development to administrators, Regular Education teachers and Special Education teachers; <b>4</b>.) We’ve assigned an on-site internal monitor to review the&#160;&#160;forms that are being implemented and <b>IEP</b> folders, that’s what Jennifer Beninato is doing at this time, and; <b>5</b>.) They also ask that we add additional staff to provide support in Science and Social Studies at Bogalusa&#160;&#160;Middle School.&#160;&#160;There were many students that were failing Science and Social Studies as well as having problems in English and math; so we have hired someone that is working with the Social Studies and Science at this point.&#160;&#160;Tonda is going to go into a bit more detail about it and then if you all have any questions on it, we’ll be glad to try and answer them," says Mrs. Craig.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>Mrs. Collett</b> came forward stating, "We’d like to thank you in advance for just listening to a little brief explanation of what this report really means.&#160;&#160;First of all, when the monitors come from the State Department and they come through Special Education for this monitoring; the reason that they’re doing that is because they are looking at records of students with disabilities; and that’s who we are; but&#160;&#160;first and foremost these are Bogalusa City Schools students.&#160;&#160;So, when we receive findings and they are asking for corrections, these corrections affect Bogalusa City Schools; not just Special Education.&#160;&#160;I know Mrs. Adams said when she was here last yea she said that Special Education has become a service; it’s no longer a place, because these children where these citings were found; these children are all in regular education classrooms; they are just receiving services through Special Education.&#160;&#160;So, remembering that, we have like two thousand plus (<b>2,000+)</b> kids in Bogalusa City Schools.&#160;&#160;Of the two thousand plus (<b>2,000+</b>) students; six hundred plus (<b>600+</b>) have <b>IEPs</b>; so these are all of our students, these are not any longer Special Education students; they’re Bogalusa City Schools’ students.&#160;&#160;So, when we have a plan in place that we are trying to make improvements with, this affects everybody in the system, not just Special Education. &#160;We just wanted to make sure that everybody is clear on that.&#160;&#160;Secondly, what I want to tell you is that the first time they came in <b>09-10</b> they asked us to provide information to them ahead of the monitoring that would focus on our eighth grade (<b>8<sup>th</sup></b>) students that were failing <b>LEAP</b>; and our sixteen year old (<b>16</b>) and older students who had transition plans in their <b>IEP</b>.&#160;&#160;Transition plans are those supports and services that kids get to prepare them for post high school; so that’s what they were looking at in <b>2009-2010</b>.&#160;&#160;They came; and they reviewed records; they observed classrooms and they interviewed administration; so of all that data that they collected in <b>2009-2010</b> they cited thirty six (<b>36</b>) issues of non-compliance; in <b>FAPE</b> as Debbie referred to; and in <b>Transition</b>.&#160;&#160;Well, <b>FAPE</b> means that according to the law these students are not getting support and services to help them progress in general education; not in special education; in general</span> <span style="font-size: 10.0pt;">education, so they were cited for <b>FAPE</b>; and they were cited for <b>Transition</b>.&#160;&#160;So, what do we have to do?&#160;&#160;We all came togethe we in-serviced; we met; we in Special Education in conjunction with the State Department, came up with a plan and we implemented it for the rest of that year.&#160;&#160;We just sent our last packet of support documentation <b>February 15<sup>th</sup></b>.&#160;&#160;The monitors came back in November of <b>2010</b>.&#160;&#160;This time when they came back they said…, (Pausing before completing this statement), we had an interview with them ahead of time; and they said you’ve made drastic improvements.&#160;&#160;Everything you said you were going to do for <b>Transition</b>, you did; so they took us out of "<b>corrective action</b>," for <b>Transition</b>, because we did what we said we were going to do; and now our children are getting the supports they need to go beyond high school; so we did really well there.&#160;&#160;They also had all of the great things that we did for <b>FAPE</b> issues as it related to our students that were failing eighth grade (<b>8<sup>th</sup></b>) <b>LEAP</b>.&#160;&#160;But this time when they came back in November, they said we want you all to give us information on your students with disabilities that are failing two (<b>2</b>) or more subjects. So, we had to provide them with that information, before they came. &#160;Based on the information that we gave them, they chose the schools to go to.&#160;&#160;We didn’t know until the morning they got here where they were going.&#160;&#160;They went to <b>Bogalusa Middle School</b>; they went to <b>Superior Avenue</b>; and they went to <b>Pleasant Hill</b>, to look at folders; and records for children with disabilities that were failing two (<b>2</b>) or more subjects. When they went in, they did the same thing.&#160;&#160;They interviewed administration; they talked to faculty; went in to observe the classroom; and they looked at folders.&#160;&#160;Based on what they saw they found citings for twenty two (<b>22</b>) of the folders; out of all the folders that they saw they found issues with twenty two (<b>22</b>).&#160;&#160;The largest common denominator for us was behavior.&#160;&#160;They cited that our students had behavior plans that were not being implemented; and that was a denial of <b>FAPE</b>.&#160;&#160;Our students are open to discipline, just the same as any student if those procedures are being followed.&#160;&#160;But if they are not being followed, they cannot receive the same consequences. &#160;They have to follow the law, which is what part of our job is, to make sure that everyone is doing that; because the monitors said based on what they saw from the discipline problems, the next time that they come we may be monitored&#160;&#160;for discipline; and we’ve never been there; and if we’re to go there, all of&#160;&#160;our documentation on discipline across the board has got to be correct; and that’s a big thing that everybody has got to work on; and that’s regular education, special education, administrators, everyone in the system, to improve&#160;&#160;the discipline, that is going on in the schools.&#160;&#160;So, that’s what they looked at.&#160;&#160;There were other issues of <b>FAPE</b>, but the common denominator in a lot of the citings was behavio related to behavior.&#160;&#160;So, what do we have to do?&#160;&#160;Again, we have to come up with a plan. &#160;We go in and we talk to everybody in the schools.&#160;&#160;We, in conjunction with the State Department; when I say we; Special Education; but we in conjunction with the State Department develop a plan; and we have it.&#160;&#160;It has been approved and that’s why we’re here tonight because once they approve the final plan, we have to come before you and tell you what we’re doing.&#160;&#160;So, in <b>January 2011</b>, we started implementing this plan; and I have documentation right now, to send them for <b>March 1<sup>st</sup>,</b> that is probably that high, already, (Using her hand to illustrate the height). Now, we have to send in documentation just about every other month and/or quarterly through <b>June 2012</b>, to meet what we’ve been asked to meet in this plan.&#160;&#160;So, we have a lot of work to do between now and <b>June</b> <b>2012</b>.&#160;&#160;But, what I want to end with is that, for us to come out of corrective action, this is an effort that will require collaboration between regular education, administration and Special Education. &#160;So, though we’re here tonight giving you a report, that came through Special Education, this report is about Bogalusa City Schools students; and what we need to do to prove, that they are getting the support from the services they need, so that they can progress in the general education curriculum; that’s where they are; and that’s the future; that’s where they are all going to be.&#160;&#160;Thanks a lot for listening to us.&#160;&#160;Are there any questions for us,” concluded Mrs. Collett?</span></p>

That woman was going back and forth; but at the same token, she maintained that school.&#160;&#160;The children that were coming through that office were children that were repetitious, over and over again.&#160;&#160;Also, Bogalusa Middle School, gave their first Anti-Bullying program; and it was a success.&#160;&#160;We had people from all over to come; and listen and enjoyed our program.&#160;&#160;Our children acted excellent; they were fantastic; and I have to give it to Ms. Moore, the teachers and our students, we were very proud of them.&#160;&#160;Mrs.&#160;&#160;Duke attended and also our Superintendent.&#160;&#160;The next thing, our school does not need part-time police people on our campus.&#160;&#160;That’s the reason why you hired the disciplinary person that we have, Mr. McKinley.&#160;&#160;Mr. McKinley, so far the time he has been there, our school is cool and calm.&#160;&#160;We don’t need officers on our campus.&#160;&#160;Again, I have to commend Ms.&#160;&#160;Moore for what she has done, due to the absence of the Principal right now.”&#160;&#160;Ms. Taylor mentioned that one day Mrs. Horne was on the campus and she (Ms. Taylor) asked to speak with he she needed to show her&#160;&#160;something.&#160;&#160;She took her to the gym where the old lockers where water was running and a backdoor that needed to be repaired.&#160;&#160;"I wrote it down for Mrs. Horne, and what happened is within a couple of days that issue was solved.&#160;&#160;Also, fifth (<b>5<sup>th</sup></b>) graders do not need to be on Bogalusa Middle School Campus.&#160;&#160;We have no facility for these kids.

(The remainder of this statement was not able to be understood).&#160;&#160;That’s not why I came before you.&#160;&#160;I came before you about the Football Coaching position at Bogalusa High School.&#160;&#160;Now, we all want to be a Lumber Jack stadium; and we all want a winne but right now those kids are two (<b>2</b>) months behind on off-season conditioning; because there is no coach there.&#160;&#160;Someone made a statement about Ms. Ard making mistakes and yall working with her through her mistakes. I feel that Coach Jones has made a mistake and I think it’s time for us to sit down and work with people to resolve areas of concerns that we have.&#160;&#160;One thing I’ve learned about Bogalusa; most people call it the Paper Mill Town; but this is the rumor town.&#160;&#160;And, right now I have heard so many rumors surrounding Craig Jones; so my thing is it’s unfair for him to be still in limbo; and it’s unfair to the kids; the student athletes at Bogalusa High; because we want them to be competitive; and most schools right now are in off-season conditioning drills. &#160;They’re lifting weights; they’re running; they’re getting themselves prepared for the next season; but our kids are further behind because we’re sitting in limbo.&#160;&#160;I would recommend that this Board will work with Coach Jones, whatever problems or concerns you may have with Coach Jones, work with him because the one thing I’ve seen that he has developed is a relationship with these children.&#160;&#160;I don’t think Coach Jones should be blamed for the decline in attendance at Lumber Jack Stadium on Friday nights.&#160;&#160;It’s going to take a community to get behind Bogalusa High School and Coach Jones; and come to football games, we need these kids to look up in the stand and see School Board Members; we need the community to look in the stands and see people who work at the School Board Office.&#160;&#160;We need everybody to come out and get behind these kids and I guarantee you’ll start to see a difference.&#160;&#160;Thank you," concluded Mr. McKinley.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10.0pt;">At this point <b>President Kates</b> stated, "I’d like to thank everyone for their comments, we appreciate it.&#160;&#160;This Board is going to work with this community and we want the community to work with this Board.&#160;&#160;We want to move forward.&#160;&#160;We want Bogalusa High School to move forward.&#160;&#160;We want Bogalusa Middle school to move forward.&#160;&#160;We want all of our elementary schools to move forward.&#160;&#160;We are in this to educate our children and it is time for all of us in this community work together.&#160;&#160;We want the media to work with us.&#160;&#160;We want the media to say positive things about our school system, which sometimes the media do not say positive things about our school system.&#160;&#160;The only thing we ever see is about Franklinton or other schools; but Bogalusa has positive things too.&#160;&#160;And we’re asking you, Mr. Meek, sometime give us a positive feedback," says Mr. Kates.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;"><b style="font-weight: bold;">Comment from Reverend Mims</b>-"Somebody mentioned the football team, I don’t care who the coach is this Board is going to have to give a coach some Assistant Coaches.&#160;&#160;One man can’t do it by himself, he needs some help.&#160;&#160;Whatever it is; whatever those coaches positions are those people needs to bring in some help and they need to be able to bring in people. &#160;I guess; if there’s anyway possible they need to bring in people they know that they can work with also; and that is something we should consider."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10.0pt;"><b style="font-weight: bold;">Comment from Mr. Hymel-</b> "All other school does that.&#160;&#160;When they hire a head coach they let them bring in some help.&#160;&#160;We haven’t at Bogalusa High School in years and years and years.&#160;&#160;And. I’m telling you that’s the only way.&#160;&#160;You’ve got to give a coach a chance; and if you don’t let him get some help you’re looking for a failure.&#160;&#160;I’m not going to vote on anybody to be a new head coach; or Coach Jones or anybody else if you’re not going to give him some help; it’s not fair."</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;"><b style="font-weight: bold;">Statement from President Kates</b>- "And on the coaching issue, we will get ready to resolve that real soon."</p>
