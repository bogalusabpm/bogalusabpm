<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><b><u>Kenneth Martin</u></b> stated his address as 2624 South Columbia, Bogalusa.&#160;&#160;He then stated that he was representing the Bogalusa Federation of Teachers.&#160;&#160;“I remember about 35 years ago when they hired me at Mandeville High School and I was living in Bogalusa and they told me it’s important that I lived in the community. I asked to stay at home in Bogalusa and they told me that; ‘No, we want you to be a part of the community. And I would just to mention to the board that some of our problems with the young teachers are people that don’t live here. They’re not involved in the community; they don’t know the kids. Our success, if you go back and look at the teachers who have been successful here over the years; the coaches, the teachers; guess what, they all lived here. So they all had a stake in the community after they got off from work.&#160;&#160;And it’s very important.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">I’m sort of known as a person who knows most of the kids. It’s only because I live here and I go to most of the things, from dance recitals to little league games. That diffuses your discipline problems. If you don’t know the kids, you go to church with them. If you don’t know the kids, you’re going to have problems; if you know the kids, their parents, whatever.&#160;&#160;So, it wasn’t that they didn’t say it, but they told me if you want to be hired here in Mandeville you have to live here. And I think when you get young people fresh out of college. I know some teachers that have come here, and look at the retention sometime that has happened&#160;&#160;If they don’t make it, they couldn’t handle discipline or whatever, it’s probably because they haven’t had a stake in the community, and that’s very, very important.&#160;&#160;You’ve got to be able to understand the kids to be able to deal with the kids.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">At the Federation of Teachers we look into the future and we think the future’s bright. There are a lot of good things going on in Bogalusa and it’s certainly good enough to live. You do not want to tell anybody that we’re doing great and&#160;&#160;your kids doesn’t go to school here, all your interest is in somewhere else.&#160;&#160;I can truly say that they’re my kids. Because I’m here, I’m with the kids, I believe in the kids, and my kids went to school here so I have a vested interest; and I chose to come back here. I’d just like to put that out there to the individuals who recruit new teachers. You get teachers that have been out there 30 years, they’re not going to sell their house to move here; but we’re talking about the young teachers that you bring in here. I think that with human resources or whomever handles that should tell the people about investing in the community and being a part of the community.&#160;&#160;That’s just my thought.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><b><u>Jeffery Simon-</u></b>Mr. Simon did not clearly state his address, nor was it listed on his “Request for Recognition as a Speaker” card.&#160;&#160;His voiced concern was regarding discipline problems and the Zero Tolerance and that he had spoken with the Principal at the junior high about the way they schedule the kids in the classroom. “They have them going in groups. Those kids are together all during the day. If they have a problem with one another, there’s no way can they get away from that child, because they’re with that child all day. I brought that up to the principal and also I talked to some of the teachers and they all said that it was some of the problems too. She didn’t care. She told me that there was no way they could change it.&#160;&#160;And yes, it can be changed.&#160;&#160;&#160;She didn’t want to go through the procedure; she didn’t want to do nothing about it.&#160;&#160;I feel like that’s a problem.&#160;&#160;If we’re going to have zero tolerance, we need to do our part, to see what we can do to prevent the problem, instead of adding to the problem.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Next, Mr. Simon addressed a problem with his child at the junior high; stating that his child received an “F” in P.E.&#160;&#160;“I asked how you could have an “F” in physical education.&#160;&#160;So I decided I’d go to the school and sit in some of her classes.&#160;&#160;I go to the classroom; and you’ve got one group of kids over here; one group over here, one group over here; and the teacher is sitting there drinking her a coke; marking down F’s. What is she doing?&#160;&#160;She’s a math teacher.&#160;&#160;She shouldn’t have any business in the P.E. class anyway.&#160;&#160;You need to put some qualified people where they need to be.&#160;&#160;Thank you”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">There was a question asking, are we going to give him a solution; what were we going to do about it?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><b>Question from President Kates-</b>“Superintendent, do you want to address that?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><b>Response from Superintendent Smith</b>- “I’ll be glad to look into it. We’ve been looking … (This statement was interrupted by Mr. Simon) stating, “Don’t tell me something just to tell me something. I’ve heard that before. Every time we come to a meeting you’ll say we’re going to look into it and nothing’s ever done.&#160;&#160;Nothing ever changes. It’s always the same.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><b>Statement from President Kates</b>- “Well, all I can respond to that is, under state guidelines, Board Members,&#160;&#160;none of us up here can get involved in the day-to-day operations of the school system.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><b>Question from Mr. Simon- “</b>Well, why are you all here then? Why are y’all here then? We don’t need y’all. We need somebody who’s going to get involved in the system.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><b>Statement from President Kates- “</b>I’m just explaining to you the law from the state.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><b>Question from Mr. Simon- “</b>Well, why are we paying y’all then? That’s what I’m saying. What are y’all here for if y’all can’t get involved in anything?”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>

I had a daughter to shall I say semi-graduate?&#160;&#160;“I don’t know how you want to put it, interrupted President Kates.”&#160;&#160;Mrs. Peters continued, “I say semi-graduate because I’ve been coming to board meetings for years, I’ve been going to the school for years and there has not been a change. We have a teacher that was out; her husband was bringing her work to the children. Then he would pick it up and she in turn would put in grades. You have not taught my child anything. So how do you expect her to pass a test? Because could have opened the book, got the answers; you gave it to her.&#160;&#160;The sub is there doing nothing, and you got A, A, and then you got a C. When you were there she was making A’s. When you left, the C might be fine, if you were teaching her. You were teaching her when you were there and you’re not going to do anything and you’re going to give her a C? Some of our teachers; not all of you; some of you, are teaching; the rest of you are just there for a check. It’s not right. It’s not fair to the children. You get yours, I got mine. It’s not right.&#160;&#160;In the street I hear that certain appointments are being made to the board office; Mrs. Hoppen retired. I hear Ms. Varnado; if you’re here, I’m not talking behind your back, is supposed to get that position. Ms. Mingo was supposed to get the position in the board office and that was shot down. She didn’t get it.&#160;&#160;Now I hear that she’s up for that. Why would you take somebody that doesn’t have the years of service; and somebody have all these years that has worked with our children; can communicate with the parents; get along with the children; and put them in the office now and put Ms. Varnado where she does not need to be. &#160;Number one I don’t know if you, Ms. Smith, go to the rooms or the schools and watch teachers and principals for evaluations; that’s part of your job.&#160;&#160;You have not been here long enough to make that kind of decision. And if you have the board working with you because it’s my cousin or my friend’s daughter, that don’t work. It’s serious. Yes. I don’t like the sound of it, I didn’t. I’m not talking behind your back. I’m telling you. If you’ve made that decision, it’s wrong. And you; and I have a good relationship, but if you do something like that, when your evaluation comes it should be “F” and out. You failed the test.&#160;&#160;Now, I’m telling you so somebody doesn’t have to come to you tomorrow and say Mrs. Peters said this and Mrs. Peters said that. And you know I’m telling the truth.&#160;&#160;I’ve been coming, coming, coming, and it’s the same thing all the time. I’m so sick of looking stupid. I think about coming up here in a clown suit sometimes.&#160;&#160;People are laughing at us from state to state.&#160;&#160;Number one we can’t get along here, so how are we going to get out there and do something for those children? You had 80% percent of the kids that walked across that stage didn’t get diplomas.&#160;&#160;And I know, I know they’re not all dumb. They’re not being taught. You got the girlfriend-boyfriend thing going on over the children; that’s wrong. Children come to talk to you; you don’t have time. That’s what we; I say we, but I don’t work in the system; that’s what you get paid for; to take time with these children.&#160;&#160;You don’t know, Little Johnny might be acting a fool because he’s hungry. Did you try to feed him? Did you talk to him? Now I’m going to tell you this and I don’t know how far it’s going to go; but I’m tired of the mess, and if I have to get out there and walk picket and jump up and down for somebody to get the attention that needs to come in here and do something with these schools I will. Thank you.”</p>

Last night I heard, flip the schools. Then they talked about teachers moving; inconvenient. They need to be inconvenienced. They aren’t doing anything else. Children might not like to go here. You go where you can go to school.&#160;&#160;You closed all these other schools and they went somewhere else. What about now?&#160;&#160;What about now? That’s a lot of money for a portable building. You’ve got a school right there; Columbia Street. I understand that it’s in better shape than the rest of them.”&#160;&#160;Vice President Kemp stated, “I’m afraid not.”&#160;&#160;“Well, whatever school you got that’s in good shape you needs to go there and put that one hundred thousand (<b>$100,000</b>) dollars in there to renovate it; instead of putting a portable building. The wind might come and take it away. Of course the Lord can take a brick building; but I feel safer in a brick building than I do in a portable. That’s stupid.&#160;&#160;&#160;That’s stupid; wasting the children’s money,” says Mrs. Peters.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">At this point President Kates recognized Mr. Vic Boyles.&#160;&#160;Mr. Boyles stated, “One thing I need to make you aware of is I spoke with Mike Billings of William Scotsman before I came up here. He’s telling me that if you choose to go this route that the buildings can be delivered the week of the 23rd through the 27<sup>th</sup>; which is a major factor. He’s hoping the 23rd and the 24th they could be in here, but he’s also telling me the week of the 23rd through the 27th. The 27th pushes it mighty close.”</p>

And again, just like in delaying the consolidation I had concerns for children’s safety. Now, as far as that goes, we have our security system, our cameras in place, not only on the premises, but also in the classrooms. That was something that I felt was necessary for that move. And as far as buildings are concerned, in flip-flopping schools with the technology based learning of the tech school, we don’t have the capabilities at the middle school. We can’t put them in place before the beginning of school. So, whatever we do, one way or the other, we are going to affect the learning process plus or minus. Teachers have worked diligently since school has been closed to get their rooms in order and prepare for the upcoming school year. If we had to move not only students and teachers then not only are you affecting the learning process of the students. You’re affecting morale of the teachers in the process. So it’s a double edged sword. It matters not what we do. You can’t please all the people all the time. You can only please some of the people some of the time.”&#160;&#160;<b>Mr. Simon</b> added, “Well, comfortable kids are going to learn better Kids learn better in a comfortable environment.” <b>&#160;Mr. Creel</b> continued, “And that’s my point.&#160;&#160;Now, the portable buildings, it’s not one portable building, it’s multiple portable buildings. &#160;It will actually be an additional eight (8) classrooms.&#160;&#160;Those portable buildings will have a restroom in them and I think they will provide an environment conducive to learning for those children.

<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;"><b><span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Statement from Vice President Kemp-</span></b> <span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">Just to kind-of piggyback on what he said; a couple of things extra.&#160;&#160;We still don’t know; but we suspect that the middle school will be in <b>AUS</b>, Academically Unacceptable School. If that is the case, the state mandates that we must offer school choice. Because Northside Tech is the same population of students’ grade wise that is the only other choice so we offered it up early so that we wouldn’t be waiting until the last minute. So where hose parents who choose for their child to go that school could, whether it is because it was an <b>AUS-1</b> school or because that would be a better environment and learning style for their child. So we offered a school of choice. Now, could this have been done earlier? Sure, it may have been done earlier, and then flip-flopping schools may have been an idea. We have three, four weeks left before school; we’ve got to make some quick and crucial decisions to keep the learning environment as steady and as fast-moving as well for these children; and if we flip-flop the schools, we’re disrupting teachers, we’re disrupting the community. We have one year before we consolidate both schools to that high school. That’s our plan. It’s been the plan since day one, and we’re going to do what’s best for our children so that they can succeed. You have to understand, there are state mandates that we do not have control of and it says that we have to offer choice, just like every parent should have a choice where their child goes to school. If you child can get a better education at a school within this system, great, you have that choice, that’s your child. If your child can’t get a better education at one of those schools the state allows you all kind of choices at this time. It’s a whole new world for choice in education. But we’ve got to anchor down, get a job done and educate our children and those things that were stated, yes, that’s not educating children. We’ve got to make sure that those effective teachers, no matter where they’re from, they’re effective and that they’re teaching our children. But when it comes down to it, we’re mandated, and there are certain things that we do not have control of and that the state does.”</span></p>

I know it would have been an adjustment and contractors could have sectioned off the high school safely and made it where kids could have been going to school for the Fall of the year. So the Board postponed it for a year so that went. That’s why I voted no, because I didn’t want to waste no money.&#160;&#160;We need to be saving.

I realize we’ve had him here before and the public was here but they didn’t say anything but this time make sure; maybe even take out an advertisement in the paper saying that we are going to have a public hearing on the redistricting plans, and then don’t decide it that night; but let the public have any input, by mail or however, and put it on the agenda for September to vote on whatever plan you all voted for.”</span></p>

So if you find that you have a white shirt or a black shirt on the campus at the time when the middle school kids are out there, he is easily identified. So that’s why we are pushing for that.” “Is there some type of emblem for the New Tech they can put on their shirt,” asked Vice President Kemp?&#160;&#160;“If they choose to,” replied Mr. McKinley.</span></p>
