And, I want to reiterate to Bogalusa; sometimes life seems hard to bare, full of disappointment with test scores so low; but then we have to remember that it’s in the valley we grow.&#160;&#160;If we stayed on the mountaintop and never experience pain, we would never appreciate our purpose for existence and living in vain.&#160;&#160;We have so much to learn, and our growth is at times very slow, sometimes we need the mountaintop, but it’s in the valley we grow.&#160;&#160;We do not always understand why things happen the way they do; but I am sure of one thing, we’re going to get through to each of our students; and that is true.&#160;&#160;While down in the valley, we can’t see the floor.&#160;&#160;The common core would, if implemented get us to our performance score.&#160;&#160;It takes striving, and reaching for the mountaintop to see that it’s in the valley we grow.&#160;&#160;Bogalusa City Schools will continue to strengthen each of our students in their education each day, to share with them our love that is not rare to help them find their way, to the top of education, and, yes I declare.&#160;&#160;Thank you Bogalusa City School Board for entrusting me; for this is one thing I know, we&#160;&#160;may now be in the valley so low; but in the mountaintop where we are headed, for I&#160;&#160;know in my heart, Bogalusa City Schools will definitely grow.&#160;&#160;Finally, I ask that each employee be a team player, and committed to helping each student reach their full potential.&#160;&#160;We must be dedicated, and willing to give one hundred (100%) percent to improving our schools, by improving our state school performance scores.&#160;&#160;We have the plan; you know what we need; we know what needs to be done; and now we must implement it.&#160;&#160;Let us all remember that we are all in this together.&#160;&#160;Thank you for your confidence in me, and my ability,” says Superintendent Breaux.</p>
