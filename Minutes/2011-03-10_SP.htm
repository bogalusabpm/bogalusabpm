<p style="font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;"><b style="font-weight: bold;">Mr. Bob Rogan-</b> Mr. Rogan came forward stating, "I’m Bob Rogan.&#160;&#160;I guess I know almost everybody in the room; but I live on Highway 21, at Lee’s Creek; and I’ve been here for forty-five (<b>45</b>) years.&#160;&#160;I want to thank you for being on this Board.&#160;&#160;I realize that this is one of the most difficult elected positions you’ve got here because I’m sure you get ten (<b>10</b>) complaints; for one (<b>1</b>) accolade. I didn’t come to bring a grievance; in fact on my card I put 'School Vision.'&#160;&#160;I want to tell you that I am very much in support of this Board, very much.&#160;&#160;The reason I’m here is to talk about; and I’m going to be brief, where are we going?&#160;&#160;And, I know you all have some views of where you’re going; and all I’m trying to do is bring you a little, I hope you can say non-bias opinion.&#160;&#160;The reason I’m here is; I’ve been involved with the WDF which is an economic development group here in the parish and I’ve been on there many years. &#160;We’ve got a new chairman last year, Dr. Laravia; he had been here a few years; but he said look, how about the people on the Board giving me some advice about what’s keeping us from attracting more businesses; more industries and so forth; and as you would expect, what it came down to; people said we need better roads; and we need some education improvements; and you know all of this, you’ve heard all of this.&#160;&#160;So, I ended up writing a lette and I’m going to leave a copy of it with you.&#160;&#160;What I concluded when I looked at these schools, other schools, so forth; and so on, from a layman’s point of view, I finally concluded, it is too difficult in a small town like this to bring about a lot of change.&#160;&#160;It’s a hard thing to do. &#160;We know each other, we really are gracious people, we don’t like hurting other people’s feelings; that’s the kind of the characteristic of the Deep South; but at the same time, we’ve got to face up to how we are; and&#160;&#160;I’m really here to encourage you.&#160;&#160;I’m really here to tell you, I support change.&#160;&#160;I’ll do everything I can to support that; but to do that, I want to give you some information; and the information is not generally positive; but you’ve heard that kind of thing before. &#160;I’m only doing this to say hey, we’ve got a lot of upside and not too much downside.&#160;&#160;I’m not an educato I don’t have advice about where to go; but I know we need to go; and I think you know we need to go." At that point Mr. Rogan began to explain what he had gathered.&#160;&#160;He went on to say that the information was gathered primarily from the State Department of Education. He also stated that the top part of the information dealt with <b>School Performance Scores</b>. "You know, the State Board of Education provides a massive amount of information; and you all probably know almost all of this; so what I’ve tried to do is put it in a category of how we compare to those around us; so the top part is the <b>School Performance</b> information. &#160;You have to understand, the State Board of Education runs about a year-and-a-half behind.&#160;&#160;That’s the problem, they are telling us things that happen in the past. &#160;So, this is the latest data, the <b>2008-2009</b> data; and the <b>School Performance Scores</b> as you know better than me, is mostly test results; but it also builds in information about the graduation rates and all that kind of thing,” added Mr. Rogan.&#160;&#160;He then directed the Board’s attention to the top of the page of the information that was issued to them; and stated that the state average was just a number for comparison of scores that are done to the individual schools; and that the state’s average is ninety-one (<b>91</b>).&#160;&#160;Mr. Rogan continued, "So, what I did was, I began to look at how we’re doing here; and you can see that; and you know because you’ve been through this <b>Academically Unacceptable</b> situation; and gotten out of that; we’ve gotten out of that; but you can see that we’re not doing well.&#160;&#160;In fact, I looked at every high school in <b>Tangipahoa</b>, <b>St. Tammany</b> and <b>Washington</b>; and unfortunately, the <b>Bogalusa High School</b> has the poorest score of all those high schools.&#160;&#160;That’s information.&#160;&#160;That’s not an indictment, that’s information.&#160;&#160;So, there it is.&#160;&#160;But now let’s drop down and look at the Middle School and I looked at the scores from <b>Franklinton</b>, and <b>Bogalusa Middle School</b>; and the scores are not very appealing there either, for us.&#160;&#160;Then, I looked at the elementary schools; and the elementary schools are close to state average.&#160;&#160;In fact, you had two (<b>2</b>) schools, when this data was collected; two (<b>2</b>) schools got very, very high academic progress; that’s <b>Byrd Avenue</b> and <b>Superior Avenue</b>. You can see how we compare to 5<sup>th</sup> Ward; 6<sup>th</sup> Ward.&#160;&#160;The elementary schools are competitive.&#160;&#160;It’s an interesting thing. &#160;Now, look at the bottom; and look at what happens as people go through the system.&#160;&#160;You start out at an elementary score as a group, that’s pretty close to the state’s average; then as they go through the rest of the school; Middle School and High School the scores deteriorate, deteriorate, deteriorate.&#160;&#160;I went through the parish system and saw how the scores were there.&#160;&#160;We don’t see that.&#160;&#160;The scores for Franklinton Elementary is comparable to the elementary over here; the high school is up in the nineties; the middle school up in the nineties; so there’re things going on.&#160;&#160;I want to stop right here and talk about one of the reasons I am here is,&#160;&#160;when I got these scores, I looked at this and said you know this says, a year-and- a- half ago, whenever this was, Superior Avenue was the best school in the system; and I asked a few people, what’s going on at Superior Avenue?&#160;&#160;And they said, 'They’ve got one heck of a good Principal over there.'&#160;&#160;And I said, 'Who’s that?' And they said, 'It’s a Ms. Ard.'&#160;&#160;I said, ’I don’t know Ms. Ard; I’ve never met Ms. Ard; but I thought, man we need more Ms. Ards.&#160;&#160;Then, I read in the paper, all of this what’s going on with Ms. Ard; and I thought, boy I’m missing something somewhere here; I&#160;&#160;don’t know so, I’ll leave that lay.&#160;&#160;But, I couldn’t imagine why we would take somebody that had the best performing school; and then went to high school and became unsatisfactory.&#160;&#160;I’ll leave that lay."&#160;&#160;Next, he began to give some other information based on the pictures of graduates from last year that he counted that was in the newspaper.&#160;&#160;Mr. Rogan said that this was not from the state.&#160;&#160;According to Mr. Rogan, there were seventy-six (<b>76</b>) graduates from Bogalusa High School, over two-hundred (<b>200+</b>) graduates from Franklinton; the parish actually had, according to Mr. Rogan, three hundred thirty four (<b>334</b>) graduates.&#160;&#160;He also stated that there were nearly as many graduates at Pine, as there were at Bogalusa High School.&#160;&#160;Continuing, he went on to say that the state gives you one dollar per pupil of expenditures in a system; and he didn’t know but he assumed that it is done the same for all the systems.&#160;&#160;The state average, again according to Mr. Rogan, is a little over ninety seven hundred (<b>9,700+</b>) dollars per pupil; that’s what is spend; that’s what the state spends.&#160;&#160;”Look at this, Tangipahoa, eighty- two hundred ($<b>8,200</b>); Washington Parish System,-ninety-five hundred (<b>$9,500</b>); I put City of Monroe in there, just because it’s a city system, nine thousand, nine (<b>$9,900</b>); St. Tammany Parish, ten thousand, three (<b>$10,300</b>); East Feliciana, ten thousand, five (<b>$10,500</b>); Bogalusa City, eleven thousand, eight (<b>$11,800</b>). We spend more money per pupil than most systems in this state.&#160;&#160;Now, some of it’s because it’s a little system; and we’ve got to have people; and it’s a little system.&#160;&#160;But, what it boils down to is, we are spending a lot of money and not doing very well with it.&#160;&#160;Now, this Board isn’t responsible for that, some of you have been on the Board a while; but this is not the Board. &#160;To tell you the truth, this is all of us, over the thirty (<b>30</b>) years.&#160;&#160;This is what happens when we all just continue down the road; figured we’d get bette figured we’d get bette and I’m as guilty as anybody; all of us are that’s been here a long time we let it go this far.&#160;&#160;So, I’m here to tell you, I really support change; change is hard, you’ve got to think about it.&#160;&#160;There is a lot going on in education in this country; a lot.&#160;&#160;We probably have the best opportunity.&#160;&#160;&#160;I think we can do this here; really we can.&#160;&#160;So, I encourage you to do this.&#160;&#160;I’m up here advocating for the seventy-six (<b>76</b>) graduates we just had; and for the seventy-six (<b>76</b>) that’s coming this yea and next yea and next year.&#160;&#160;We’re not doing them right.&#160;&#160;I’ve seen too many that couldn’t fill out a job application; they couldn’t read a tape measure.&#160;&#160;We have got to help these folks.&#160;&#160;I think the public is ready.&#160;&#160;I’m with you, I support you; if there’s anything I can do to help you just call on me.&#160;&#160;Thank you very much," concluded Mr. Rogan.&#160;&#160;(<b>Supporting documents are on file with the minutes</b>).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">There being no one else to come forward to address the Board in Public Session, President Kates resumed to special session.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;"><b style="font-weight: bold;">Statement from President Kates-"</b>It’s on the table for discussion; but I want all the Board Members to know that the Superintendent did have her secretary to call me yesterday and see when the earliest I could meet with her was, and I told her when I got off from work at three-thirty. I did come down.&#160;&#160;I met her in her office and she gave me this letter.”&#160;&#160;President. Kates read the letter to the Board Members and the public that stated, 'To Whom It May Concern, I will be retiring as Superintendent of Bogalusa City Schools at the end of business day, March 11, 2011 for personal health reasons.&#160;&#160;He then indicated that it was signed, Mrs. Ruth Horne.' (<b>Supporting document is on file with the minutes</b>). President Kates continued, ”And for that I think this Board needs to; under personnel, I’ve asked Mrs. Dillman to draw up personnel; and on the Personnel Agenda; we’re there now, I’d like to let her….(Pausing and not completing this statement).&#160;&#160;Looking at the Board President Kates asked, ”Does anybody have anything to say?&#160;&#160;I’d like to bring it to the public, does anybody in the public has anything to say," asked President Kates?&#160;&#160;At this Point he turned it over to Mrs. Dillman who presented the Personnel Agenda.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;">There was a question of whether to vote on the items separate, and President Kates stated that line items <b>1 &amp; 1a</b> would be voted on together since they were pertaining to the same thing; and line item <b>1b</b> would be voted on separately.</p>

I’d just like to say that it’s going to take participation from the public to be informed; and participate in any changes that this Board chooses to institute or try to institute.&#160;&#160;All of my kids were educated in the public school system.&#160;&#160;They all have a college degree; and they got their mother’s smart.&#160;&#160;Things have declined, like you said the last thirty years.&#160;&#160;I graduated from Bogalusa High in 1969; and in the years prio and ten years after, we were up there.&#160;&#160;I know we’ve lost a lot of good teachers over the years, to other systems because of the money; and we’ve lost a lot of students to other system for other reasons.&#160;&#160;We need to draw that proverbial line somewhere; and take that step forward to bring this system back, because that’s what’s going to bring Bogalusa back."</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-size: 10pt;"><b style="font-weight: bold;"><u style="text-decoration: underline;">Mr. Calvin Hymel</u></b>- "Mr. Rogan again, I would like to thank you on behalf of the Board; and I want to let you know that I’m really not that negative; but I’m not scared to vote "no," if that’s what we’ve got to do to help these kids in our schools, that might be what we have to do; vote "no," because we’ve got to move forward."</p>
