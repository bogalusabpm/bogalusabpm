<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">“Thank you President Kates.&#160;&#160;First I’d like to say, and I was hoping that Mr. Branch was here tonight, I would like to give him an open apology.&#160;&#160;Let me tell you, when I feel like I’ve done something wrong, I’m not too big to apologize; and he did come in and talk to me during the week.&#160;&#160;We discussed certain things, and I still think that some things were not handled professionally and appropriately, and he agreed to that, because if I don’t know something, then what am I supposed to do, but I do want to apologize for that.”&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">The second thing is, we had a person that had come in wanting to lease a bus to the school system.&#160;&#160;&#160;We have had problems with this person over and over and over and over again.&#160;&#160;In fact, he filed a suit against me and Mrs. Walker, as soon as I got here; a discrimination suit against us, but I can deal with that kind of stuff.&#160;&#160;But, anyway he brought in some documents and Ms. Mingo noticed that they looked like they were fake, so, she got with Mrs. Walker and they went down to the Motor Vehicle, and they&#160;&#160;were definitely fake.&#160;&#160;I called the Chief of Police, Joe Culpepper and asked him if he could come in and help us with the case, and if there was any way he could be prosecuted and sent off.&#160;&#160;He did come in at one-thirty, and he noticed that even on the paper….(Pausing and not completing this statement).&#160;&#160;He had to go for himself even though we had verified everything; he had to do it, I guess as part of the law; but he told us he had to go back to the Motor Vehicle to see if it was falsified.&#160;&#160;He did.&#160;&#160;He came back and said that it was.&#160;&#160;He had changed one number in the serial number.&#160;&#160;He called the place where the bus had come from.&#160;&#160;He called the Chief of Police there.&#160;&#160;The Chief of Police knew the bus owner, and he was going to get back with Chief Culpepper and find out all the information on the bus.&#160;&#160;I haven’t heard from him.&#160;&#160;Another thing is they painted the bus completely and put Bogalusa City Schools and the person’s name on the bus. So, as soon as I hear something from Chief Culpepper, I’ll send it to you in my weekly newsletter.&#160;&#160;He had his name on the paper as the owner, and he wasn’t the owner.&#160;&#160;That’s all I’m saying.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Before you look at my Personnel Report, I would just like to say; and this is not really calling anybody’s name out.&#160;&#160;I would just like the Board to reconsider or withdraw or reconsider the thing about the supervisors, and I’m going to tell you why. We’ve already had to make changes with Ms. Mingo because of the state mandate.&#160;&#160;Even though your stipulation was in place it’s been overridden by the state, so we made her…...(Pausing and not completing this statement), and if we don’t, then we have one coordinator.&#160;&#160;A coordinator responsibilities and duties are totally different.&#160;&#160;We have coordinators all out in the schools, and I think that if I need somebody to go in and supervise those schools and be able to have the authority to try and straighten out certain situations it makes my job a lot easier; because I tell all the supervisors and the principals, and I have both of them here that can attest to this, when you have a problem, you have to go to your supervisor first.&#160;&#160;I am the last resort, because I have a whole lot of things that’s going on in my life, as far as the job is concerned; and if I am going to deal with those type of things it’s just going to take away a lot of time that I can be putting in trying to come up with solutions and ways of making our school better schools; better places for our kids and bringing our kids back into the system.&#160;&#160;Now, I’m not saying hire additional supervisors, I’m not saying that; but the ones that were already in place that was strictly needed, and we only had one, because everybody else will be a supervisor and you have a coordinator, but her job description will be a job description of a supervisor.&#160;&#160;She’s still going to have to go out there and supervise schools, and handle problem. This girl has worked her behind off since she’s been here, and she has handle problems.&#160;&#160;It’s a major difference already; and you’re asking somebody to do something that other people have done, and they’ve gotten the title and recognition.&#160;&#160;Now, if you were going to get rid of the position completely, and we were not going to have that person, then that would be a totally different thing, but if you’re replacing somebody; if Phlesher quit today, you would still have to get another supervisor, if Debbie Craig quit, because that’s state mandated, we will still have to get another supervisor.&#160;&#160;I am pleading with you; this is not the solution right now.&#160;&#160;There are a lot of things that needs to be done. This lady is going out there; she’s doing them.”&#160;&#160;At this point Acting Superintendent Breaux gave an example of an email she had received from a teacher that stated the principal told the staff that if they wanted to leave on their planning period to go to the doctor, they had to ask her.&#160;&#160;“Now, I don’t have time for that, straight-up.&#160;&#160;I just don’t have time, and that’s not my job.&#160;&#160;If&#160;&#160;you are an administrator and you don’t know whether or not you can release your&#160;&#160;teacher and you can’t tell them yes or no, you don’t have any kind of….(Pausing and not completing this statement),&#160;&#160;nothing about yourself, then you don’t need to be here&#160;&#160;in my situation.&#160;&#160;I called the principal, and I told the principal that. These are the kind of things I have to deal with,” says Acting Superintendent Breaux.&#160;&#160;Acting Superintendent Breaux gave another example of an individual that came in and she had to get secondary person to deal with, because the person was certified in all areas, but could not handle the children.&#160;&#160;She went on to speak of incident she had witnessed at Bogalusa Middle School, regarding this individual.&#160;&#160;“I really and truly don’t have time for this small stuff.&#160;&#160;I know you all don’t want any supervisors.&#160;&#160;I’m not asking you to create a job for a new supervisor, but this supervisor is very, very, very needed.&#160;&#160;Now, we’ve talked about cuts, and we have made some cuts at this office, and I am planning on making some more.&#160;&#160;That is going to be one of the things that I am going to bring up to you probably in January, getting some of these people out of here, I’m telling you right now.&#160;&#160;That’s the next thing on the agenda.&#160;&#160;People are already walking around not speaking and all of that, but I can deal with that.&#160;&#160;I’ve got to do what’s best for our system and what’s best for our children.&#160;&#160;We’ve got to improve in achievement, if we’re going to survive, and now we have competition coming in here, so we don’t have any room to play.&#160;&#160;But, would you please consider that, that’s all I am asking.&#160;&#160;It is for the benefit of the school; it is for the best for these schools; it is so this person can get out to these schools to supervise, help develop, and do things of that sort.&#160;&#160;I am trying to salvage and save as many kids as we possibly can.&#160;&#160;But Board Members I ask you to please, please go along with me on this; and I am going to do some cuts.&#160;&#160;I have some that I have already figured out, just please don’t get rid of the supervisor.&#160;&#160;A coordinator is not the person for a curriculum job; they’re just not the person, because you still have the same duties; the same responsibilities.&#160;&#160;It’s just not fair.&#160;&#160;It’s not fair to the system.&#160;&#160;It’s not fair to the students.&#160;&#160;It’s just not fair.&#160;&#160;Just consider that for me; and I’m not asking you; I don’t even want you to create any more positions, I’m not asking that.&#160;&#160;Just let this position…(Pausing and not completing this statement),&#160;&#160;this person jumped up, and jumped ship in the middle of the stream, and we’re going to drown if we don’t get what we need.&#160;&#160;I’m asking you to go along with me on this.&#160;&#160;&#160;I don’t ask you for a lot now, I don’t ask you for a lot, but I’m asking, please, please, please don’t disappoint me on this.&#160;&#160;I need that person.&#160;&#160;I need that person in that position because it helps to stabilize everything.&#160;&#160;It’ll make my work easier; I can go ahead on and do other things that need to be taken care of.&#160;&#160;That’s it.&#160;&#160;Thank you,” concluded Acting Superintendent Breaux.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><b style="font-weight: bold;">Response from Acting Superintendent Breaux</b>-“Well, it’s a new position….(Pausing and not completing this statement).&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No, what it is, it’s going to give a person more responsibilities.&#160;&#160;They are going to maintain their old position; and the reason for that Mr. Kemp, we’ve got to begin to blend our funds; and we’ve got to begin to work together as a single person.&#160;&#160;We’ve got to bring in; and even though we have supervisors, certain positions shouldn’t be left up to supervisors alone, because those principals are the ones out there running those schools.&#160;&#160;They need to have some say-so, and some voice into what’s going on.&#160;&#160;I don’t think they need to be dictated to; and I wanted them brought to the table on a regular basis and we discuss what’s going on system wide. Everybody is given the opportunity to have input and make a decision, so when it gets to you all I’m hoping it would be less confusion.&#160;&#160;I hope it won’t be any, because we’ll have a better understanding.&#160;&#160;Also, it’ll give elementary the right to know what there’re going to need when they get to junior high.&#160;&#160;These people can work together and they can say; your curriculum needs to consist of this, this, and this; because when you get to junior high, this is what you’re going to encounter; when you get to high school….(Pausing and not completing this statement).&#160;&#160;And, see what happens is Mr. Kemp, and I know you’re an educator; high school says elementary didn’t do what they needed to do; junior high says…(pausing and not completing this statement), It’s just a….(Pausing and not completing this sentence).&#160;&#160;You know the reason why, because we have not really worked together as one.&#160;&#160;Elementary has always thought elementary is mine, you don’t mess with my stuff, this is me; but it’s not, these kids have got to go from PreK through high school, so it’s everybody business.&#160;&#160;Every grade is everybody’s business.&#160;&#160;Then if you got junior high; oh, this is my baby, you don’t mess with my baby; when you get to high school it’s the same thing, and that’s why we’ve had so much unsuccessful results, because people have not pooled their thoughts and their ideas and&#160;&#160;how we can better benefit.&#160;&#160;Everybody says, I do it this way; he does it this way; and she does it that way; and it does not work. It doesn’t work,&#160;&#160;So, what this person would do is, she would maintain her same&#160;&#160;position doing what she’s doing, but she would have an added position, and what she would be able to do is correlate and coordinate her efforts and work with the people and try to pull us together as one.&#160;&#160;The front foot needs to know what the back foot is doing, and it is not happening,” says Acting Superintendent Breaux.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;<b>Statement from Mr. Kemp</b>-“I agree with most of what you’re saying, but my concern is it’s a new position, and we did vote at some point that we were not doing any.&#160;&#160;My comment on that is we were given a recommendation by the state department… (<b>Acting Superintendent Breaux interrupted stating)</b>, “And that’s where that came from.”&#160;&#160;Mr. Kemp continued,” But, I would like, before we do anything…. (<b>Acting Superintendent Breaux interrupted stating,</b>) “Let’s look at it awhile.”&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr. Kemp continued, “Let’s look at what the state is recommending”&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>Acting Superintendent Breaux</b> added, “And, I brought you that last week.&#160;&#160;I don’t have it, but you remember I brought it to you Monday.&#160;&#160;That came from the state department and Mrs. Sloan, what was suggested. The other thing that she suggested; and I am working on that now; is we need a Parent Center for parents.&#160;&#160;I am working on that for next year, but that was one of the things, and the reason I didn’t really want to wait until next year, but I will adhere to whatever the Board tells me.&#160;&#160;The only thing that I am going to do is bring out things that I think you need, but it’s left up to you all.&#160;&#160;The reason I didn’t want to wait until next year, is we’re talking about academics and student achievements, and we don’t have time to wait for next year.&#160;&#160;This is something we need to really work on right now, and come together, and do the very best that we can for our children.&#160;&#160;But, whatever your pleasure is, I will adhere to it,” says Acting Superintendent Breaux.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><b style="font-weight: bold;">Statement from Mr. Kemp</b>-“I guess probably my request would be, could we… (Pausing and not completing this statement). To me this would be something that an Executive Session would be called for.&#160;&#160;We could discuss the position in personnel. (<b>Acting Superintendent Breaux interrupted stating),</b> “Well see, I didn’t want to do that.&#160;&#160;I didn’t want to hurt nobody anymore.”&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>Mr. Kemp</b> continued, “I mean we don’t vote on personnel anymore, but for the position, we would need to recant our vote that allow for a newer position or new named positions.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><b style="font-weight: bold;">Question from Mr. Hymel</b>-“But didn’t the state tell us three (<b>3</b>) supervisors?” <b>Acting Superintendent Breaux</b> replied, “Actually it was four (<b>4</b>) supervisors.&#160;&#160;It was Child Welfare &amp; Attendance, and I brought you all that last week.&#160;&#160;It had Special Ed; it had Human Resource; and Finance.&#160;&#160;<b>President Kates</b> added, “I think Mrs. Sloan said that, anything dealing with federal Programs, they could possibly fall under one.”&#160;&#160;“Yes, she did,” says Acting Superintendent Breaux. “Is it possible that we could maybe ask Mrs. Sloan to come to that meeting, so she could give us first-hand information?&#160;&#160;I’d like to hear from her.&#160;&#160;She is knowledgeable,” says Mr. Kemp. “And she would be willing.&#160;&#160;I invited her to the last thing that we had and she came.&#160;&#160;She’s real good and she’s been coming on a regular basis.&#160;&#160;She has other people on her committee, that’s been called District V Support.&#160;&#160;They have been coming; and they have been very helpful to me, and to the system.&#160;&#160;I don’t think it’s going to be a problem inviting her to come,” says Acting Superintendent Breaux. “I don’t have a problem with your recommendation; I just want to do it legally.&#160;&#160;I want us to do it correctly,” says Mr. Kemp.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><b style="font-weight: bold;">Statement from Mr. Creel</b>-“Let me just clarify something in my own mind.&#160;&#160;This person as far as the name change as far as the position, I think that’s basically kind of irrelevant to the fact other than this individual is taking on additional responsibilities.&#160;&#160;So, I don’t see where the name change in the position is technically creating a new job.” “Is there is a difference between Supervisor and Director,” asked Mr. Kemp?&#160;&#160;The response was, “Yes.”&#160;&#160;Mr. Kemp continued, “If there is, then you are creating a new position.&#160;&#160;I am not opposed to it, I’m just saying that we need to follow legal.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">When the question was posed by Acting Superintendent Breaux asking when Mrs. Sloan needed to be here.&#160;&#160;The response was to try and get her here for our January meeting.&#160;&#160;“Okay, okay.&#160;&#160;Thank you, that’s all,” replied Acting Superintendent Breaux.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">At this point President Kates asked if there were any more Board comments.&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><b style="font-weight: bold;">Statement from Mr. Hymel</b>-“I don’t mind having supervisors, but I believe that we are going to make sure by May, that something is changed, and we’re going in the right direction.&#160;&#160;If they’re not going to be responsible, they need to make sure that whomever they’re over is made responsible.&#160;&#160;We need to have it in writing.” <b>Acting Superintendent Breaux</b> interrupted stating, “You know what, I agree with you one hundred percent.&#160;&#160;Mr. Hymel continued, “I don’t mind paying anybody anything as long as we know we’ve got the right people doing their job; but if we go down and&#160;&#160;we don’t improve, we can’t sit here……(Pausing as Acting Superintendent Breaux interrupted), stating, “Mr. Hymel, I’m not going down I can tell you that.&#160;&#160;I am not going down.&#160;&#160;Let me tell you my philosophy with my people.&#160;&#160;I tell them, even with the custodians; when Mr. Vic met with the custodians, and I go in on everything, I want them to know, and I’ve already emailed the custodians; if you can’t do what you need to do, and those schools can’t be clean; those bathrooms not smelling, then you need to go home, and I need to hire a service.” The conversation continued, to include a comment from Mrs. Lawrence, when Acting Superintendent Breaux asked her a question regarding the custodians at her school.&#160;&#160;“I told the Principals, if those test scores don’t come up, you fail; and supervisors you fail.&#160;&#160;Supervisors if you fail, I fail.&#160;&#160;It’s not going to happen; and I am staying on my toes about that.&#160;&#160;We meet about this religiously, about where we’re are; what we need to do, and I also told every principal in principal’s meeting if there is anything that you need, I don’t care what the cost is; and I meant that; if there’s anything that you need for your kids that’s going to improve achievement I said, you let me know; did I not tell you all that?&#160;&#160;This is real, because my reputation and my life is at stake too; and I don’t need any failures on my team.&#160;&#160;&#160;I think you all kind of know that because I think I’ve made some changes since this thing has happened.&#160;&#160;And, every time you’ve seen a resignation, it’s not a resignation; believe me, okay; okay.&#160;&#160;I’m going to continue to do what I need to do.&#160;&#160;If we’ve got any negative people here, I don’t care who it is; and we still have some; I’ll tell you that.&#160;&#160;I’m the first to tell you that… (Pausing, and not completing this statement).&#160;&#160;Some of them I haven’t moved because of finding the right person to put in that position; and also I don’t want to upset my kids because it’s just too close to testing them.&#160;&#160;It’s a lot of reasons, but don’t think I’m sitting here thinking that that person is doing what they need to be doing; because they are not, and they are not going to be here.&#160;&#160;I am out for what’s right.&#160;&#160;It’s like a chain reaction; you’re going to cause the next person to fail.&#160;&#160;You can’t fail with me, because I’m not accepting it.&#160;&#160;I am not accepting it.&#160;&#160;I am going to do what you tell me, but I’m going to work extra hard.&#160;&#160;My supervisors, I promise you, they’re working harder than they have ever worked.&#160;&#160;They have got to get out there; they’ve got to roll those sleeves up and get into those schools to see what’s going on; and they have to come back and report to me.&#160;&#160;I have to know what’s going on. They keep me abreast of what’s going on.&#160;&#160;I promise you we’re doing everything humanly possible, in our power, to make a difference and make Bogalusa City Schools something that you all can be proud of,” says Acting Superintendent Breaux.&#160;&#160;President Kates asked if there were any other Board comments.</p>

We want our children to get a good quality education.&#160;&#160;I do feel now that we have someone in the seat that we don’t have to worry, she do keep us informed with everything; and I do the best thing in my power to keep all the Board Members informed.&#160;&#160;I try to call them.&#160;&#160;Maybe sometime I can’t reach them, but I do leave them a message.&#160;&#160;We are here for the children, and we’re going to move this system forward.&#160;&#160;I’m like Mrs. Breaux, I don’t believe in failure.&#160;&#160;Bogalusa City School System wasn’t a failure when I was in school forty (<b>40</b>) years ago, and I don’t believe it’s going to be a failure now.&#160;&#160;I feel we are going to move forward.&#160;&#160;I think we have the support of everyone in this room.&#160;&#160;I wish you all a Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year.”</p>
