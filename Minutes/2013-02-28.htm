<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Prior to the next line item, Mrs. Walker asked President Kates if she could make a statement.&#160;&#160;Mrs. Walker stated, “In your packet I gave you some information on <b>MFP</b>.&#160;&#160;This is hot off the press.&#160;&#160;We just received it right before the meeting.&#160;&#160;This is just a draft telling us what our projected <b>MFP</b> is going to be next year. When you take a little time to look at it, you’ll see right now we’re looking at losing right at seventy-one thousand <b>($71,000</b>); but it is in different areas.&#160;&#160;We did lose some on Level One; two hundred, thousand <b>($200,000</b>).&#160;&#160;We received some from the local funding.&#160;&#160;That’s from our sales taxes and property taxes; and they also take that into consideration.&#160;&#160;&#160;You’ll see that our bottom line right now, is a negative, seventy-one thousand (<b>-$71,000</b>).&#160;&#160;But, that could change because we don’t know how many students will be going to the Charter School, or will be getting a scholarship.&#160;&#160;Also, you will see, the per-pupil, what we’re spending on each student.&#160;&#160;This year we spent ten thousand, four hundred twenty-nine thousand (<b>$10,492</b>) per student; next year we will be spending ten thousand-eight hundred dollars (<b>$10,800</b>) per student.&#160;&#160;And you see the local level we’re spending thirty six hundred (<b>$3,600</b>); and the state we’ll be doing seventy-one hundred (<b>$7,100</b>).&#160;&#160;This is something that we’ve just received.&#160;&#160;Also in the packet you’ll see how the <b>MFP</b> works and how they come up with this data.&#160;&#160;This is supposed to be voted upon next week.&#160;&#160;I just wanted to give you this handout to let you kind of know what we’re looking at and how we can plan for next year in our staffing.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><b style="font-weight: bold;">Statement from President Kates-</b>“While we’re on funds tomorrow you’ll probably get a little more information on the federal; Special Education cuts, and the Title I cuts.”&#160;&#160;“Yes, and we’re going to take all of that into consideration,” replied <b>Mrs. Walker</b>.&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>Mrs. Gill</b> added, “They haven’t broken it down by school districts, but I actually went to a webinar yesterday and they did tell us, and gave us numbers of how much Louisiana would be cut in each of those areas.&#160;&#160;I tried to get some of that E-rate information to y’alls emails; and not everybody’s went through, some of them bounced back, but I can try that; but if y’all would like hard copies mailed, I could get Ms. Lois to actually mail y’all the hard copy of&#160;&#160;what those copies would be if everybody would like that.&#160;&#160;Is that something you all would like?”&#160;&#160;“Yes, for our district, so we’ll find out how much money we will lose,” said President Kates.&#160;&#160;“But, did they say for 2013-2014; or 2014-2015,” asked Mrs. Walker?&#160;&#160;Mrs. Gill stated, “It’s fiscal year 2014, so it’s not actually going to affect us until next year.&#160;&#160;I can tell you like Title I is a five percent (<b>5%</b>) cut.&#160;&#160;So, if you did it for Title I here in this district, I estimated that’s like an eighty thousand (<b>$80,000</b>) dollar cut that we will get off the top there.&#160;&#160;Title II, they said will be impacted more because they’re trying to get rid of that.&#160;&#160;“That’s our concern when we’re doing our staffing for next year; we have to take all of this into consideration.&#160;&#160;And, with the retirees, we have, we’re still hoping more people retire.&#160;&#160;We do have a good list right now.&#160;&#160;Hopefully, we’re going to tighten up; and stay within our budget,” said Mrs. Walker.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Prior to the adoption to the calendar, <b>Mrs. April Nobles</b> made a statement regarding a change since Monday night at the Committee Meeting.&#160;&#160;“In your blue folder that’s on the table tonight, based on some of the recommendations that was made at Committee Meeting on Monday.&#160;&#160;The addition of President’s Day was placed on the calendar; therefore, it extended the school year by one (<b>1</b>) day.&#160;&#160;That was at this point the only extension; or the only change to the calendar that you saw on Monday, that was voted on by an employee.&#160;&#160;Also, on your calendar you’ll see; I know there were questions about number of minutes; instructional minutes and days that are required.&#160;&#160;The original Bulletin 741, the first sheet that you have in the stapled portion of your packet, has now gone away.&#160;&#160;So, you now have the new revised Bulletin 741 that is in there behind that, and all instructional minutes and/or days, as far as recommendation from the state are null and void.&#160;&#160;They have given districts and schools the ability to be able to, think outside of the box, and craft a schedule that fit their students and their needs.&#160;&#160;However, looking at all the calendars that we saw from all of our neighboring districts, and ours, everyone is sticking with a traditional calendar; but it does give us an opportunity if we chose to; to&#160;&#160;extend our school day, or shorten our school day; or extend our school year; or shorten our school year.&#160;&#160;It gives us the opportunity to do that.&#160;&#160;The calendar that you see before you is a traditional calendar, as is all&#160;&#160;of our neighboring calendars,&#160;&#160;that sticks with what we’ve always had; the same number of days on that calendar,&#160;&#160;as we have this year,” says Mrs. Nobles.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><b style="font-weight: bold;">Mr. Creel</b> voiced a concern regarding the number of Professional Development days, targeting a summit that was held prior to the beginning of the school year.&#160;&#160;His concern was if that was something that is done every year.&#160;&#160;Ms. Debbie Jenkins stated that that was something that was done last year, because there were not enough professional development especially with Common Core Compass coming in, and she wanted the teachers to feel like they knew what was going on before then.&#160;&#160;“And, our teachers were paid to come,” said Ms. Jenkins.&#160;&#160;“Was that a required attendance, or was that at their option,” asked Mr. Creel?&#160;&#160;“That was at their option, but we had a wonderful turn-out in attendance for the most part with all of our teachers,” said Ms. Jenkins</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;“I’d just like to say that Mr. Creel, Mr. Hymel and I attended a School Board Meeting for&#160;&#160;four (4) parishes; Washington Parish, City of Bogalusa, St. Tammany Parish, and Tangipahoa, in Amite.&#160;&#160;It was very informative.&#160;&#160;They gave us a lot of information.&#160;&#160;I will share it with the Board Members.&#160;&#160;It’s too much.&#160;&#160;They talked about some of the things Mrs. Walker talked about; cutting federal programs and also they talked about the BAM Score.&#160;&#160;The Superintendents are not in agreement with the BAM Scores, they said that should have been piloted, because a teacher’s whole life and career depends on that score; and to just take this year and do that, they didn’t think that was right, so they’re looking into that.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">“They also talked about; and I agree with it even as an Acting Superintendent, I think that they have given the Superintendents too much power, because what that means, even for me, it could be a situation where you had somebody in there who does not have the system at heart, and was thinking only about their personal feelings, and their friends, and that type of thing, so what they’re doing is thinking about giving some of that control back to the Board.&#160;&#160;I think that is absolutely necessary.&#160;&#160;You as a Board have to vote four (<b>4</b>) to three (<b>3</b>); but me as a Superintendent, I can just kind of do whatever I want to do, and I just don’t think that’s fair.&#160;&#160;I think that is something that should be reconsidered, and that is why I have tried to make you trust me, and let you know that I’m fair and always bring things&#160;&#160;to you even before I do them.&#160;&#160;I don’t have to do that, but I do that as a courtesy, because I want your respect and I want your approval.&#160;&#160;There were some other things that Mr. Creel and Mr. Hymel wanted to speak on; but I will get you a copy of that.”</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">“As I told you on Monday night, we are going to start working with supervisors every day.&#160;&#160;We’re going to start working on placements, getting these schools ready, because I want my job.&#160;&#160;We need to get this in place so Mrs. Walker can look at figures and tell us; not only do we want it in place, but fact is, we want teachers and students, when we start school&#160;&#160;in August, we don’t want to be confused.&#160;&#160;We want people to know where they’re going; and know what they’re doing.&#160;&#160;Also, we are doing this as a cost-saving measure so we want Mrs. Deloris to be able to give us some financial proof that this is going to be a cost-saving thing.&#160;&#160;And hopefully, hopefully, well not hopefully; in our April meeting I promise we’ll have that kind of tied up together.&#160;&#160;I want to thank you again for the opportunity, and again I want to praise my teachers, and my supervisors, and my students.&#160;&#160;I love Bogalusa City Schools, and I’m hoping that the community would change their view of us and began to work with us, because a school cannot exist without a community.&#160;&#160;We need your help and your support.&#160;&#160;We are trying to do the right thing&#160;&#160;We are going to make some mistakes, we’re only human; we’re not Jesus Christ, and the thing about me is when I make a mistake I’m&#160;&#160;not ashamed, because I am human;&#160;&#160;to tell you that that&#160;&#160;was a mistake that I made, and give you my reason why.&#160;&#160;So, thank you again, and hopefully we can bring this system back to where it was.&#160;&#160;I am itching for it.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;"><b style="font-weight: bold;">President Paul Kates-</b>“We have struggled in Bogalusa for a while, and when I first took the seat of President I asked the staff , superintendent and&#160;&#160;Board Members for all of us to work together.&#160;&#160;It takes this entire community to build this school system.&#160;&#160;Board Members, I think we all should be talking to parents trying to get them to send their kids back to Bogalusa School System.&#160;&#160;We are striving on the right path.&#160;&#160;I still feel that we have internal problems with people trying to still cut us down, to help the others.&#160;&#160;I feel that way.&#160;&#160;I can see it.&#160;&#160;I hear it all the time.&#160;&#160;But, my feeling now is, if you don’t want to be on the Bogalusa team, you ought to leave; because if we can’t trust one another and work together for the benefit and betterment of our children, put them first and try to educate them, you don’t need to be on the Bogalusa team.&#160;&#160;If we’re going to be on the Bogalusa team, we’ve got to support the Bogalusa Schools.&#160;&#160;We’re not here to be compared with nobody else; we’re here to move our system forward, and to show our community, that our kids can learn just like any other school system.&#160;&#160;We all have to be on that same team.&#160;&#160;I ask that we get behind whoever will be the superintendent; our next superintendent, in which I do hope it do be Mrs. Breaux myself, because she’s doing a wonderful job, but each Board Member have their own decision to make, and now that we are to that point; we’re advertising for that job, it’s time for us to put stability in the Bogalusa School System.&#160;&#160;I hope all the Board Members feel the same way.&#160;&#160;I love Bogalusa High School.&#160;&#160;I love Bogalusa City Schools.&#160;&#160;I’m a product of it; my son was a product of it; and I hope everybody supports this system.&#160;&#160;&#160;I ask for the community to get back on board with us.&#160;&#160;Thank you.”</p>
