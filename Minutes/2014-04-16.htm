So, the teachers chose Core Knowledge; and I want to say it was a very good choice, because it is recognized by the state now as number one (1) in the skills strand. So, we’re doing what we need to.&#160;&#160;And because of this; we give a <b>DIBLES</b> test at the beginning, middle and end of the year, and our children; right now, mid-year has scored some of the highest that there’s ever been.&#160;&#160;&#160;We’re even trying to reach higher than we’ve ever reached; and I can say that now, we’re very high; and hopefully we’ll get even higher.&#160;&#160;I want to show you what’s going on at Byrd Avenue.&#160;&#160;This is a showcase.”&#160;&#160;At this point Mrs. Lawrence by way of Mrs. Chaisson presented a PowerPoint of the activities at Byrd Avenue Primary School.&#160;&#160;“Thank you Mrs. Lawrence; and your faculty as well,” says President Kemp.</font></span></p>

She is a mature, poised, self–possessed, dedicated student; and her grades are exemplary.&#160;&#160;She is joy to have in the classroom; the words of <b>Ms. Ann Johnson</b>, her Chemistry Teacher.’ ‘Daphne Owens has a pure thirst for knowledge; and I like how he says she has a pure thirst for knowledge.&#160;&#160;She’s determined and motivated in her studies; will not rest until she has found a solution to every question in class.&#160;&#160;Her consistency to strive for excellence is apparent in her college goals, as well as her course work.

Our Student of the Year, grades 9-12, Miss Daphne Owens,” concluded Principal McKinley.&#160;&#160;“And Daphne is a familiar face, for those of you who are frequent at Board Meetings, because she’s also our Honorary School Board Member.&#160;&#160;She also holds a job, and all these other extra-curricular things, that we have to call, sometimes to get her out of, to come to the Board Meetings. We’re very, very proud of you, and all of your accomplishments,” says Mrs. Nobles.&#160;&#160;“She’s also on her way to Howard University,” added Principal McKinley.</font></span></p>

What we’d like to offer Bogalusa High School in the sideline coverage at the football games.&#160;&#160;As much as we are involved in the training of Our Lady of the Angels Hospital, there are some limitations, but we’d like to start with football first.&#160;&#160;&#160;Once again with that situation, we’d like to reach out to the community.&#160;&#160;We appreciate you guys welcoming us here tonight,” concluded Dr. Umarvadia."</font></span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><font size="2" style="font-size:10pt;">So, if we can, to lessen your load Ms. Adams’ as well, do a summary, I don’t think we have to have word-for-word in your minutes every time, and if any Board Member &#160;would like that information see Ms. Adams for word-for-word,” added <b>President Kemp</b>.&#160;&#160;I only ask because I wasn’t present at the meeting.&#160;&#160;I read some things in the newspaper, but I… (Pausing and not completing this statement), says <b>Mr. Kates</b>.&#160;&#160;“I think with that, it was difficult to hear, and she tried to the best of her ability, so I ask her to put that back into the minutes.&#160;&#160;And again, I don’t always think it’s necessary to have word-for-word, I&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;think we can just summarize what occurred in each department and each uh… (Pausing and not completing this statement).&#160;&#160;And, with the Board’s permission, I’d like from here on out to just do a summary,” said <b>President Kemp</b>.&#160;&#160;“I think it was pretty important,” says <b>Mr. Hymel</b>.&#160;&#160;“Like I said, I requested that information, because it was left out.

At the end of the discussion Attorney Lewis asked that the resolution be passed so this won’t occur again.&#160;&#160;Different concerns were voiced to include one of <b>Principal Lesley McKinley</b>, of <b>Bogalusa High Schoo</b>l.&#160;&#160;“The bottom line with the LHSAA right now, is everybody is trying to stack the deck to win championship.&#160;&#160;It’s not about academics.&#160;&#160;It’s got Charter verses Public Schools.&#160;&#160;It’s got Select verses Non-Select.&#160;&#160;You know, you can talk about ineligible players; we can talk about the local championship around here a few years ago.&#160;&#160;Nobody said a word about all of those players outside of the district; across to the west over there.&#160;&#160;Nobody is really about education.&#160;&#160;Everybody; just as the Charter Schools plays to a different set of rules, as do the public schools. &#160;That’s where you’re going with these championships in sports.&#160;&#160;It’s not about education.&#160;&#160;Regardless to what you guys do, the powerful will prevail in this thing.&#160;&#160;We vote on the rules; and that’s the big fight right now, is recruitment. &#160;Unfortunately those private schools; those with the boosters with the money, regardless of what we vote on in Baton Rouge; again it’s not about education.&#160;&#160;It’s about the trophy cases in your schools.&#160;&#160;Now, the test of the coach is not the number of trophy cases at the schools; but it’s where your athletes are ten (<b>10</b>) or fifteen (<b>15</b>) years down the line.&#160;&#160;That’s what you’re dealing with. When we go to LHSAA, it’s not about education.&#160;&#160;&#160;We want to talk about sportsmanship. &#160;We want to talk about playing by the rules. Ain’t nobody playing by the rules; nobody.&#160;&#160;When it comes to; like I said, it’s the same thing with the Charter Schools; Charter Schools have students that get MFP, but we’ve got to produce the certified teachers; we have to produce the highly qualified; but poor Bogalusa, we can’t go recruit Franklinton, Covington, or wherever; and Poplarville, but everybody else gets to do that.&#160;&#160;And, it is unfair.&#160;&#160;This travel thing we had to go to the other side of Lake Charles, and about thirty miles north of Lake Charles to a game; that’s out of our hands.&#160;&#160;But the bottom line is, regardless to what you guys do, it’s already been done.&#160;&#160;It’s not about education, and that’s the problem.&#160;&#160;The problem ain’t Bogalusa High School; the problem ain’t Bogalusa Middle School.&#160;&#160;The problem is we disguise rules, and you only want certain people to abide by them.&#160;&#160;Now if we are for the children, then we sit down at the table, we don’t put us on blast in the public; we sit down at the table, and we discuss these things.&#160;&#160;At LHSAA, there are class leaders; A, 1A, 2A, 3A, all the way up to 5A; and then there is Select verses Non-Select leaders, whereas that’s the problem, these small public schools are tired of being beat up by these John Curtis’s and all of these folks, you know, who get to recruit around the nation; and, that’s your problem there.&#160;&#160;I just feel strongly that regardless of what you guys do, that’s a LHSAA problem that we will have &#160;to deal with when we get back&#160;&#160;over there in January ,” said Mr. McKinley.&#160;&#160;“I’m trying to make sure they follow the rules.&#160;&#160;That’s why I want you to pass this Resolution,” said Attorney Lewis.</font></span></p>
